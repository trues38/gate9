## 1) The Rashomon Effect (4개국 시선 교차)
*   🇺🇸 **US View**: Taiwan's increased defense spending signifies escalating threats from China, prompting the U.S. to reconsider its strategic alliances in Southeast Asia, potentially leading to heightened military support for allies and intensifying regional tensions.
*   🇨🇳 **CN View**: China's assertive diplomacy justifies its military postures, particularly against Japan's actions which are perceived as a coalition against China's interests, revealing a need for China to solidify its own strategic partnerships amidst growing U.S. influence and Taiwanese defense budgets.
*   🇯🇵 **JP View**: Rising public outcry regarding energy policy reflects broader discontent, while increased militarization in Taiwan requires Japan to balance defense needs with internal political stability, effectively re-evaluating its role in a region that is rapidly militarizing.
*   🇰🇷 **KR View**: South Korea's tech advancements, like the Nuri launch, are timely amid soaring Taiwanese defense budgets, which may call for a collaborative defense posture with the U.S. and Japan to counterbalance China while navigating local social issues.

👉 **Conflict Insight**: The juxtaposition of military escalations in Taiwan against China creates a complex web of responses, showcasing different priorities and methodologies among nations that impact economic and security dynamics across East Asia.
