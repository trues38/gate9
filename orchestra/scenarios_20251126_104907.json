The focus on military expenditures, such as Taiwan's increased defense spending, leads to a market environment characterized by fear and unwillingness to invest. As sanctions and trade barriers escalate, key industries like technology and manufacturing experience severe setbacks, resulting in economic contraction throughout the region. Stock markets plummet as consumer confidence wanes, leading to rising unemployment rates and social unrest.",
