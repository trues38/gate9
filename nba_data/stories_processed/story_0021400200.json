  "cleaned_body": "PHILADELPHIA --  The Portland Trail Blazers didn't take the winless 76ers lightly following a lackluster first half.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge had 15 of his 33 points during the pivotal third quarter to help the Trail Blazers defeat Philadelphia 114-104 on Monday night, sending the 76ers to their 14th straight loss to open the season.\n\nWesley Matthews added 17 points, Damian Lillard had 16 and Robin Lopez chipped in 12 for Portland (11-3), which won its eighth in a row after coming back from a two-point halftime deficit.\n\n\"They came out with a lot of energy; we came out a little sluggish,\" Aldridge said. \"They woke us up.\"\n\nMichael Carter-Williams led Philadelphia (0-14) with 24 points.\n\nThe 76ers moved within one loss of matching the franchise mark for consecutive losses to begin a season and will look to avoid an 0-15 opening when they host Brooklyn on Wednesday. They also are just four losses from tying the 2009-10 Nets, who set an NBA record by beginning the season 0-18. If the losing continues, Philadelphia could break the NBA record for losses to start the season on Dec. 5 when hosting Oklahoma City.\n\n\"Nobody is rolling over or pointing fingers,\" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. \"This locker room is great. You go home and sleep OK. It wasn't that bad. There were a lot of positives tonight.\"\n\nAfter taking a halftime lead for just the fifth time this season, Philadelphia upped its two-point advantage to its biggest of the game when consecutive layups by Carter-Williams and Henry Sims made it 56-50 early in the third quarter. And Philadelphia's lead again was six, 58-52, on Carter-Williams' two free throws with 10:33 remaining in the period.\n\nBut it was all Portland from that point. The Blazers went in front on Aldridge's drive that made it 63-62 with 8:10 left in the period and then continued to pour it on. Nicolas Batum's dunk with 4:02 remaining in the third gave Portland its largest lead to that point, 80-68, and capped a 6:31 stretch in which the Trail Blazers outscored Philadelphia 28-10.\n\n\"The biggest lesson is how hard you have to play to win,\" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. \"Every night is a challenge. To be able to come back against a team playing with desperation means a lot.\"\n\nAldridge had three straight baskets during the run, including an alley-oop dunk on Steve Blake's pass. Aldridge was 5 for 5 from the field in the period to help Portland enter the fourth with an 89-80 lead. Aldridge ended 13 for 20 from the field\n\n\"That's my job,\" Aldridge said. \"If things stall, I try to get things going.\"\n\nSims finished with 22 points and Tony Wroten added 20 for the 76ers, who went 0 for 8 from 3-point range.\n\nA pair of Carter-Williams free throws with 6.6 seconds left before intermission gave Philadelphia a 52-50 halftime lead. Wroten led Philadelphia with 10 points at the break.\n\nThe Trail Blazers also helped Philadelphia with 14 first-half turnovers, but they committed just three in the second half.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTrail Blazers: Portland's winning streak is the best since winning 11 in a row from Nov. 8-25, 2013.. . Portland, which entered second in the NBA in made 3-pointers per game (10.1), was 2 for 12 from the arc at the break and finished 7 for 27.\n\n76ers: Philadelphia's worst start in franchise history was set during the 1972-73 season when they also finished with the worst, 82-game record in league history at 9-73. . Fans behind the basket used boxes of macaroni and cheese as noisemakers on a night when those who brought a box to the game received a free ticket to a future contest.\n\nSHOOTING BLANKS\n\nBy failing to hit a 3-pointer, Philadelphia snapped a streak of 209 straight games with a made 3-pointer.\n\nDOUBLING UP\n\nAldridge added 11 rebounds to his point total, giving him five double-doubles on the season. It also was the 27th time since the 2011-11 season that he has recorded a double-double while scoring at least 30 points.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPortland plays at Charlotte on Wednesday.\n\nPhiladelphia hosts Brooklyn on Wednesday.",
