  "cleaned_body": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Wendell Carter Jr. scored 10 of his career-high 30 points in the fourth quarter and the Orlando Magic handed the Oklahoma City Thunder their ninth straight loss with a 90-85 victory Sunday night.\n\nCarter also had 16 rebounds to help the Magic end a three-game losing streak.\n\n“I feel I was able to stretch the floor tonight. That's the next step for me as a big man,” said Carter, who made 12 of 15 shots including a couple of 3 pointers. “I made some shots tonight and that's really about it.”\n\nDarius Bazley led Oklahoma City with 18 points. The Thunder shot 32.6% and were 13 of 48 from 3-point range. But Orlando didn't move ahead for good until Franz Wagner scored on a rebound with 2:24 remaining.\n\n“At halftime we were very frustrated because we didn't shoot the ball well,” Carter said. “But we had to establish our identity on defense.”\n\nThe Thunder, the NBA's lowest-scoring team (103.1 points per game) and poorest shooting team at 42.6%, were playing without their top three scorers, including Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who injured his ankle Friday night at Miami.

Orlando scored the final 14 points of the quarter and led 45-43 at halftime.\n\nThree-pointers by Theo Maledon and Vit Krejci helped Oklahoma City close the third quarter with a 9-1 spurt , and the Thunder moved ahead by seven points before going on another scoreless stretch of more than four minutes.\n\nTwo free throws by Isaiah Robey with 2:46 left gave the Thunder their last lead. but Wagner, Carter and Cole Anthony scored the next eight points for Orlando and the Magic led 88-81 with 24 seconds left.\n\n“We have them too many second chances,” said Isaiah Robey, who had 11 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder. “They did a better job of finishing out the game than we did.”\n\nTIP-INS\n\nThunder: The Thunder had only nine available players. ... G Kenrich Williams (sprained right knee), C Derrick Favors (sore back) and Gilgeous-Alxeander might be able to play Monday night. . . . The Thunder gave up 116 points or more in each of their first eight losses of the streak.\n\nMagic: G Jalen Suggs missed a third straight game with an ankle injury. ...
