{"game_id": "171213009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 On a night where offense was a precious commodity, Latrell Sprewell waged a one-man war against the Sacramento Kings and dragged the Golden State Warriors to a gritty 95-91 victory.\n\nIn a defensive struggle that saw both teams shoot below 40% from the field, Sprewell was an unstoppable force of nature. He erupted for a game-high 41 points, a monumental scoring effort that accounted for a staggering 43% of his team's entire output. While his teammates combined for just 54 points, Sprewell's will to win was the undeniable catalyst.\n\nThe Warriors, feeding off their star's relentless energy, built a 15-point lead and appeared to be pulling away. But the Kings, led by Mitch Richmond's 25 points against his former team, refused to capitulate. Sacramento clawed back, turning the final minutes into a tense, possession-by-possession battle.\n\nYet, every time the Kings threatened, Sprewell had an answer. He attacked the rim with ferocity, drawing fouls and converting from the line, going a perfect 10-for-10 on free throws. His scoring barrage provided just enough cushion to withstand Sacramento's final push.\n\nIn the end, the statistics told the story of a historic individual performance. Beyond his 41 points, Sprewell filled the sheet with 9 assists, 5 rebounds, and 4 steals, a complete effort that underscored his dominance. Richmond\u2019s 25 points and Corliss Williamson\u2019s 22 points and 12 rebounds were noble efforts for the Kings, but they were ultimately rendered secondary.\n\nOn this night, the game belonged to Latrell Sprewell. In a grind-it-out contest where points were at a premium, he was the sole exception, carrying his team to victory on his back with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
