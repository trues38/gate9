{"game_id": "180106006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "AP SPORTS\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2013 The hardwood floor of Reunion Arena transformed into a private stage for a historic virtuoso performance Tuesday night. In a game that will be remembered not for its final score, but for the singular force who dictated it, the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Michael Finley authored a masterpiece, torching the Denver Nuggets for a career-high and franchise-record 49 points in a 108-90 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Finley was operating on a different plane. He was a whirlwind of offensive efficiency, slicing through the Nuggets\u2019 defense with a devastating blend of explosive drives and pinpoint jumpers. Each basket seemed more audacious than the last, a relentless assault that left Denver scrambling for answers that simply did not exist.\n\nFinley\u2019s 49-point eruption wasn't just a high-volume shooting night; it was a clinic. He shot a blistering 68 percent from the field, a testament to his shot selection and scorching hot hand. When he wasn't finishing at the rim, he was drawing fouls, converting 11 of his 13 attempts from the charity stripe. He complemented his scoring tour de force with 9 rebounds, falling just one board short of a remarkable double-double, while also dishing out 5 assists.\n\nThe Nuggets, led by a valiant 25-point effort from LaPhonso Ellis, were merely spectators to the Finley spectacle. Any attempt to mount a challenge was met with another flurry of points from the Mavs' star. This was not a team win; it was an individual coronation. On this night, the story was Michael Finley, who didn't just beat the opposition, but carved his name into the record books with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
