{"game_id": "171117022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND \u2013 In the record books, it will appear as a 120-75 demolition by the Portland Trail Blazers over the Dallas Mavericks. But the final score is a mere footnote, a piece of administrative trivia overshadowed by a singular, seismic performance that turned a regular-season game into an indelible piece of NBA history.\n\nThis was the night Isaiah Rider ascended into the stratosphere.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rider was not merely a participant; he was a force of nature, a virtuoso conducting a symphony of scoring against a helpless Dallas defense. He slashed to the rim with ferocious intent, elevated for pull-up jumpers with effortless grace, and when he found his rhythm, the net barely moved. Shot after shot found its mark in a display of offensive artistry that left the Memorial Coliseum crowd in a state of escalating awe.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the statistic was almost incomprehensible: 41 points. Rider didn't just lead all scorers; he *was* the scoring. He single-handedly outdueled entire segments of the Mavericks' roster, his output a stark contrast to the collective struggle of the visitors.\n\nWhile the Trail Blazers' victory was a complete team effort\u2014a dominant 45-point margin of victory speaks to a wire-to-wire dismantling\u2014the narrative belongs irrevocably to one man. On this night in 1998, Isaiah Rider didn't just win a game; he authored a masterpiece. He provided a blinding flash of individual brilliance so profound that it forever defines this contest, a legendary 41-point explosion that time cannot diminish.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
