{"game_id": "180102023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In the annals of basketball, some victories are orchestrated by a collective effort, and others are seized by the sheer will of a single, dominant force. On this 1998 night in ARCO Arena, it was the latter, as Mitch Richmond authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Vancouver Grizzlies in a 94-80 Kings victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was uncontainable. He wasn't just scoring; he was conducting a masterclass in offensive execution, slicing through Vancouver's defense with a devastating combination of power and precision. The Grizzlies, helpless to find an answer, watched as he piled up points from every conceivable angle on the floor.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard told the story of one man's brilliance: Richmond had poured in a staggering 47 points, a total that dwarfed the contributions of entire starting lineups. He was the engine, the heart, and the soul of the Sacramento offense, his output nearly matching the entire Grizzlies' first-half total. While his teammates provided crucial support\u2014notably Olden Polynice\u2019s 12 points and 15 rebounds\u2014this night was unequivocally about Richmond.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 defense, anchored by Polynice\u2019s work on the glass, successfully muted Vancouver\u2019s attack, holding their leading scorer, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, to a quiet 19 points. But all strategic notes were merely footnotes to the main event. Richmond\u2019s 47-point explosion was not just a game-high; it was a historic statement, a reminder of his elite status and a night that forever belongs in Sacramento Kings lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
