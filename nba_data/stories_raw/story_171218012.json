But every time they threatened, Vaught had a response\u2014a put-back, a mid-range jumper, a powerful move in the paint. His 43 points were not just a personal triumph; they were over half of his team\u2019s entire output, a staggering statistic that underscores his singular impact.\n\nIn a game where both teams shot under 40% from the field, this was not a contest of finesse but of grit.
