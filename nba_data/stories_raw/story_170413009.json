(AP) \u2014 The Phoenix Suns didn't need a playbook Tuesday night. They had Kevin Johnson.\n\nThe veteran point guard authored a scoring masterpiece, erupting for a game-high 44 points to single-handedly power the Suns to a 105-97 road victory over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Johnson was uncontainable, slicing through the Warriors' defense with a relentless assault at the rim. His performance was a study in efficient dominance, carrying the offensive load for a Suns team that otherwise struggled to find consistent scoring beyond his backcourt mate, Jason Kidd, who added 17 points.\n\nThe Warriors, led by Joe Smith's 25 points and 12 rebounds, hung tough throughout, battling to a narrow 74-72 deficit entering the final quarter. But every Golden State run was met with a cold-blooded answer from Johnson. Whether it was a driving layup through traffic or a pull-up jumper, the Suns' captain had the response, stifling any momentum the home team tried to build.\n\nHis 44-point night overshadowed a strong all-around effort from Golden State's Latrell Sprewell, who finished with 21 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds. But on this night, there was no counter for one man's brilliance.\n\nJohnson\u2019s historic outing provided the sole, formidable engine for Phoenix, proving that sometimes a legendary individual performance is all the strategy a team needs to secure a hard-fought road win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
