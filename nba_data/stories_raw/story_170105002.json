{"game_id": "170105002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 On a night when the rest of the league stood still, Dee Brown authored a performance for the ages.\n\nThe Boston Celtics\u2019 guard detonated for a career-high and utterly staggering 46 points, single-handedly carrying his team to a 109-102 victory over the visiting Phoenix Suns. In a game that will be remembered not for the final score, but for the one-man show that produced it, Brown was simply unguardable, putting on a breathtaking shooting clinic that left the Boston Garden faithful in a state of perpetual roar.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Brown was a man possessed. He sliced through the Suns\u2019 defense, his 46 points coming on an efficient 16-for-27 shooting from the field. But it was from beyond the arc where he truly built his legend, draining an unconscious 8 three-pointers. Every time Phoenix threatened to close the gap, Brown would answer with another dagger from deep, his shooting stroke a picture of flawless repetition.\n\nWhile Brown\u2019s historic night rightfully dominated the narrative, the Celtics received crucial support from Rick Fox, who added 19 points, and a towering 18-rebound effort from Dino Radja that secured vital possessions.\n\nThe Suns, despite a valiant 21-point effort from Wesley Person and a well-rounded 17 points and 10 assists from Jason Kidd, had no answer for the hurricane in green. They played a competitive game, but they were unwitting witnesses to a force of nature.\n\nOn this night in 1997, the final buzzer didn\u2019t signal just another Celtics win. It marked the culmination of a historic, individual masterpiece. The record books were rewritten, and Dee Brown\u2019s name was etched into Celtics lore forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
