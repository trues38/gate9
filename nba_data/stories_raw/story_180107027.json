{"game_id": "180107027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Michael Jordan turned back the clock.\n\nFacing the Boston Celtics, His Airness delivered a vintage 49-point masterpiece, single-handedly carrying the Washington Wizards to a heart-stopping 110-108 victory. On a night where every possession mattered, Jordan was the undeniable force, refusing to let his team falter.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Jordan was in a different gear. He attacked the rim with a familiar ferocity, hit pull-up jumpers with icy precision, and willed his team forward against a relentless Celtics attack. Boston, led by Antoine Walker\u2019s 27 points and Paul Pierce\u2019s 24, had no answer for the 35-year-old legend. Each time the Celtics threatened to build momentum, Jordan had a response, a basket to quiet the run and steady the Wizards.\n\nThe game hung in the balance until the final seconds. With the score tied and the clock dying, the entire arena knew who would take the last shot. Jordan, as he has countless times before, created space and launched a jumper that found nothing but net as the horn sounded, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.\n\nWhile Juwan Howard provided crucial support with 17 points and 12 rebounds, this night belonged solely to one man. Jordan\u2019s 49-point eruption was a stunning reminder of his greatness, a historic individual effort that carved a path to a narrow, unforgettable win for Washington. It was more than a game; it was a legend proving his timeless brilliance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
