{"game_id": "170318018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 The New York Knicks, fueled by a historic and virtuoso performance from Patrick Ewing, dismantled the Vancouver Grizzlies, 98-73, at Madison Square Garden in 1997. This was not merely a victory; it was a coronation for the Knicks' center, who delivered a performance for the ages.\n\nEwing was an unstoppable force, pouring in a game-high 44 points on an astounding 18-for-23 shooting from the field. He was a model of offensive efficiency, dominating the paint from the opening tip and single-handedly outscoring the Grizzlies\u2019 entire starting lineup for long stretches. Adding to his monumental night, Ewing was a perfect 8-for-8 from the free-throw line and pulled down 11 rebounds to complete a dominant double-double.\n\nWhile Ewing\u2019s masterpiece rightfully commanded the spotlight, he received ample support. John Starks provided a vital spark off the bench with 16 points, while Charles Oakley controlled the glass with a game-high 16 rebounds. Allan Houston added 11 points, but the night belonged to the man in the middle.\n\nThe Grizzlies, simply overwhelmed, had no answer for the tidal wave of Ewing. Shareef Abdur-Rahim led Vancouver with 17 points, and Bryant Reeves added 12, but their efforts were a footnote on a night defined by one man's brilliance.\n\nUltimately, the final score was a mere backdrop. The real story was Patrick Ewing\u2019s 44-point tour de force, a scoring clinic that etched another legendary chapter in the storied career of the Knicks' icon and left no doubt about his dominance on the hallowed floor of Madison Square Garden.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
