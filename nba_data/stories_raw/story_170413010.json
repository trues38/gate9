{"game_id": "170413010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2013 In the record books, it will go down as a 113-73 demolition of the Seattle SuperSonics. But in the grander tapestry of the game, Friday night in 1997 was something far more profound: The Night Hakeem Olajuwon ascended into a singular basketball stratosphere.\n\nThe Houston Rockets\u2019 40-point victory was not merely a game; it was a coronation ceremony held on the very floor Olajuwon dominated. The Dream rendered the final score a footnote, etching his name into history by becoming just the fourth player ever to record a quadruple-double.\n\nThe line was otherworldly: 28 points, but the true magic lay in the ancillary columns. He hauled in 16 rebounds, dished out 10 assists, and swatted away an astonishing 11 Seattle shots. Each block was a statement, each rebound a denial, each assist a testament to his complete command of the contest. The Sonics, a formidable opponent, were reduced to mere props in his historic play.\n\nWhile Clyde Drexler provided a solid 21 points and Mario Elie added 14, they were supporting actors on a stage built for one. The Summit crowd, sensing history, roared with every Olajuwon rejection, the building shaking as the unthinkable became inevitable.\n\nSeattle\u2019s 73 points stand as a monument to the defensive clinic Houston put on, a clinic led by its centerpiece. There was no answer for The Dream\u2019s two-way brilliance, a performance so complete it defied logic.\n\nOn a night when one man achieved one of basketball\u2019s rarest feats, the final score felt almost irrelevant. The real story was the stat line that will echo through time: 28, 16, 10, and 11. Hakeem Olajuwon didn\u2019t just win a game; he captured a piece of immortality.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
