{"game_id": "161123011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2014 In a defensive battle more reminiscent of a street brawl than a playoff game, the Orlando Magic escaped Market Square Arena with a 76-73 victory over the Indiana Pacers. But this was not a story of a team triumph; it was the coronation of a one-man defensive force named Horace Grant.\n\nOn a night where offensive numbers were anemic across the board, Grant\u2019s stat line was a monument to sheer will and relentless effort. The veteran forward amassed a monstrous **22 rebounds**, a figure that dwarfed the entire starting lineup of the Pacers. He added 12 points to complete a gritty double-double, but it was his command of the glass that dictated the terms of this grueling contest.\n\nThe game was an offensive nightmare. Shaquille O\u2019Neal, held to just 16 points, was swarmed in the post. Anfernee Hardaway managed only 14. For Indiana, Reggie Miller was hounded into 6-of-19 shooting, finishing with 19 points. The two teams combined to shoot a frigid 39% from the field, with every possession a precious commodity.\n\nIn this rock fight, every one of Grant\u2019s 22 rebounds was a life preserver for the Magic. He snatched crucial offensive boards to extend possessions and snuffed out Indiana\u2019s hopes with defensive rebounds, silencing a raucous crowd. His final rebound, securing a missed Pacer attempt in the closing seconds, sealed the narrow, hard-fought win.\n\nIn an era often defined by high-flying scorers, this night belonged to a blue-collar warrior. Horace Grant didn\u2019t just win a game; he put on a masterclass in determination, proving that glory can be found not just in the net, but in the trenches of the painted area.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
