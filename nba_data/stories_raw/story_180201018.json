{"game_id": "180201018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In the cauldron of Madison Square Garden, where legends are forged, the New York Knicks waged a brutal, beautiful war against the Miami Heat. But this was not a night defined by a team, but by one man: Allan Houston.\n\nIn a defensive struggle where the final score, an 89-83 Knicks victory, belied the offensive artistry on display, Houston authored a performance for the ages. Pouring in a game-high 42 points, he was an unstoppable force, a symphony of mid-range jumpers and clutch drives that sliced through the Heat\u2019s formidable defense.\n\nThe game was a typical, physical affair between these two rivals, with Patrick Ewing providing a stout 17-point, 13-rebound foundation for the Knicks. But every time Miami threatened, it was Houston who answered. He was the steady heartbeat of the Knicks\u2019 offense, his scoring output not just high, but historic, lifting his team on his shoulders.\n\nFor Miami, the efforts of Alonzo Mourning (19 points, 14 rebounds) and Tim Hardaway (20 points) were ultimately rendered secondary. They fought valiantly, but there was no counter for the singular brilliance shining across the court.\n\nOn this night in 1998, the story was simple and profound. It was the story of Allan Houston, who transcended a fierce rivalry and a grinding contest to deliver a legendary 42-point masterpiece, carrying the Knicks to a pivotal victory and etching his name into the lore of the Garden.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
