{"game_id": "161223022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND \u2014 History arrived not with a whisper, but with a thunderous, record-breaking roar from Gheorghe Muresan.\n\nIn a stunning individual performance, the 7-foot-7 Romanian center for the Washington Bullets delivered a night for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Portland Trail Blazers in a 106-84 road victory. The final score was a mere footnote to the masterpiece Muresan painted in the paint.\n\nMuresan was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points on an impossibly efficient 20-of-27 shooting from the field. He was a force of nature, commanding the post and finishing with an array of hook shots and dunks that the Trail Blazers had no answer for. His monumental effort didn't stop there; he also dominated the glass, hauling in 21 rebounds to complete a titanic 50-point, 21-rebound double-double that echoed through the annals of NBA history.\n\nWhile Muresan was the undisputed protagonist, he received crucial support from Chris Webber, who added a versatile 17 points, 11 rebounds, and 8 assists, facilitating the offensive onslaught. For the shell-shocked Trail Blazers, Isaiah Rider fought valiantly with 22 points, but his effort was a lone candle against the inferno of Muresan\u2019s historic night.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a statement etched into the record books by the league\u2019s tallest player. On this night, Gheorghe Muresan wasn't just a novelty; he was a titan, delivering a performance so dominant that it will be remembered long after the season's standings are forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
