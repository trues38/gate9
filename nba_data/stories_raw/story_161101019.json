In a 96-92 victory for the Washington Bullets over the Orlando Magic, one name eclipsed all others: Gheorghe Muresan.**\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Muresan Show. The 7-foot-7 center from Romania was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record **49 points**. He was not merely scoring; he was dominating, transforming the painted area into his personal domain. Every drop-step, every hook shot, and every put-back was a testament to his sheer size and surprising touch. The Magic had no answer.\n\nWhile Muresan\u2019s offensive explosion was the headline, his **16 rebounds** were the subplot, ensuring the Bullets capitalized on his misses and limited Orlando\u2019s second-chance opportunities. He was a one-man wrecking crew, single-handedly carrying the Bullets\u2019 offense on a night when backcourt mates Calbert Cheaney (16 points) and Chris Webber (10 points) provided secondary support.\n\nThe Magic, led by Anfernee Hardaway\u2019s 21 points and Rony Seikaly\u2019s 16, fought valiantly. They traded blows with the Bullets, keeping the game within reach until the final moments. But every time Orlando threatened to seize momentum, Muresan answered. A decisive bucket in the post, a crucial offensive board\u2014his monumental presence was the difference.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard read 96-92, but the true story was the towering figure who had just authored one of the most spectacular individual performances in Bullets history. On this night, Gheorghe Muresan wasn\u2019t just a player; he was an event.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
