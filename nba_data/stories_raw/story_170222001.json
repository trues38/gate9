{"game_id": "170222001", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ATLANTA \u2013 On a night where offense was a precious commodity, one man staged a one-man scoring clinic. Glen Rice, with a performance for the ages, carried the Charlotte Hornets to a breathtaking 93-92 road victory over the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nIn a defensive struggle where no other player cracked 20 points, Rice was a flamethrower in a freezer. He poured in a game-high 40 points, a staggering figure that accounted for over 40% of his team's total output. While teammates like Vlade Divac (15 points, 14 rebounds) provided crucial support, this was unequivocally the Glen Rice Show. His scoring barrage was the engine that powered the Hornets' offense, keeping them afloat through every Atlanta run.\n\nThe Hawks, led by Steve Smith's 19 points and a strong 17-point, 12-rebound double-double from Christian Laettner, refused to yield. The game undoubtedly came down to the final, frantic possessions, with the outcome hanging on a single point.\n\nBut on this night, one point was all Rice would need. His monumental 40-point explosion was not just a statistical marvel; it was the very foundation of a hard-fought road win. It was a historic, carry-the-team-on-his-back performance that etched his name into the lore of a classic Charlotte victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
