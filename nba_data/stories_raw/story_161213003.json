{"game_id": "161213003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 On a night where the rim seemed as wide as the ocean for everyone else, the Charlotte Hornets rode one man\u2019s historic, singular brilliance to a grinding 84-75 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers in 1997.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a defensive struggle, this was an offensive masterpiece performed by a single artist: Glen Rice. The Hornets\u2019 forward delivered a performance for the ages, exploding for a game-high 40 points. In a contest where no other player on either team could crack the 20-point barrier, Rice\u2019s scoring was not just prolific; it was the entire engine of the Charlotte offense.\n\nThe 76ers, led by Allen Iverson\u2019s 19 points, simply had no answer. Every time Philadelphia threatened to close the gap, Rice would respond with a dagger, his shooting touch from all over the floor proving unstoppable. His 40-point outburst was more than just a high total; it was a monumental carry-job, accounting for nearly half of his team\u2019s entire point production on a night baskets were otherwise painfully scarce.\n\nThe rest of the game faded into a supporting role for Rice\u2019s epic showcase. Vlade Divac\u2019s 14 rebounds for the Hornets provided crucial second chances, but they were chances almost exclusively converted by the hot hand of Rice. Derrick Coleman fought valiantly for the Sixers with 18 points, but his effort was simply drowned out by the relentless scoring tide of one man.\n\nIn the record books, this will go down as a nine-point win for Charlotte. But in the memories of those who witnessed it, this night belonged solely to Glen Rice, whose legendary 40-point night lifted his team to victory almost entirely on his own back.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
