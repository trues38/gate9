{"game_id": "161213005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 On a night when offense was a premium for both teams, one man staged a historic solo performance that will echo through the annals of the league.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers, powered by an utterly dominant 42-point, 16-rebound tour de force from Shawn Kemp, defeated the Golden State Warriors 101-87. While the final score suggests a comfortable Cavaliers victory, this was not a team win; this was the Shawn Kemp Show, a relentless display of power and skill that the Warriors had no answer for.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Kemp was a force of nature, attacking the rim with a ferocity that left Golden State defenders grasping at air. His 42 points were not merely a game-high; they were nearly half of his team's total output, a staggering individual accomplishment in a grinding contest. Each of his 16 rebounds, many on the offensive glass, further cemented his complete control of the painted area. He was simply unstoppable.\n\nThe Warriors, who were led by B.J. Armstrong's 21 points, could never find a consistent rhythm against the Cavaliers' defense. Despite 16 points from Latrell Sprewell and a double-double of 13 points and 10 assists from Mark Price, Golden State was systematically dismantled by one man's will.\n\nBut on this night, the story begins and ends with Shawn Kemp. Forty-two points. Sixteen rebounds. A performance for the ages that carved a permanent mark into the stone of basketball history and sent the Cleveland crowd home witnessing something truly special.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
