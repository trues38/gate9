{"game_id": "161204029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2014 It was not merely a victory; it was a historic annihilation authored by one man. In a performance for the ages, Reggie Miller scorched the Vancouver Grizzlies for a career-high 42 points, leading the Indiana Pacers to a staggering 127-80 road win in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was a flamethrower in a league of his own. The Grizzlies had no answer for his relentless movement and lethal accuracy. Miller didn't just score; he put on a clinic, connecting on a remarkable 7 of 11 from beyond the three-point arc. Each swish was a dagger, each celebration a testament to a player completely in the zone. He was the undeniable engine of an offensive onslaught that left the home crowd in stunned silence.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s 42-point explosion was the headline, his supporting cast executed their roles with ruthless efficiency. Rik Smits provided a formidable inside presence with 15 points, and the duo of Dale Davis and Antonio Davis dominated the glass, combining for 22 rebounds and ensuring a steady diet of second-chance opportunities. The Pacers' defense was equally merciless, holding Vancouver to a paltry 80 points and suffocating any semblance of an offensive rhythm.\n\nFor the Grizzlies, the night was an unmitigated disaster. Shareef Abdur-Rahim\u2019s 17 points were a hollow consolation prize on a night defined by the visitor\u2019s brilliance. The final 47-point margin of victory was a mere statistical footnote to the main event: Reggie Miller\u2019s career night.\n\nIn the annals of Pacers history, this game will forever be remembered not for the lopsided score, but for the night their legendary sharpshooter ascended to a personal peak, delivering a singular, unforgettable performance that left an entire arena, and an opponent, in ashes.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
