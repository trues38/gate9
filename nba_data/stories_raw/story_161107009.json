They chipped away at the Knicks' lead throughout the second half, turning the final minutes into a tense battle. Yet, every time Golden State threatened, Ewing had an answer\u2014a crucial bucket, a defensive stop, or a commanding rebound.\n\nThe Knicks\u2019 supporting cast played their roles perfectly, feeding the hot hand and providing just enough supplementary scoring from Allan Houston (17 points) to keep the defense honest.

As the final buzzer sounded, the stat sheet told a story of historic proportions: 50 points, a record-breaking feat that cemented Ewing\u2019s legacy in a single, breathtaking evening of basketball brilliance. It was a legendary performance that lifted his team to a hard-fought road win and etched his name even deeper into the lore of the game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
