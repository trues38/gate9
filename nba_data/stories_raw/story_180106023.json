On their home floor in 1998, they provided the stage for an offensive explosion so rare and so dominant that the final score, a 105-89 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, became a secondary detail.\n\nThis night belonged to one man: Mitch Richmond.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 guard delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a staggering 47 points. From the opening tip, Richmond was an unstoppable force, a symphony of scoring precision. He carved through the Clippers\u2019 defense with a scorer\u2019s ruthless efficiency, hitting from every conceivable spot on the floor. Each basket was a hammer blow, each jumper a testament to his singular focus. The Clippers, helpless, could only watch as Richmond single-handedly dismantled their schemes.\n\nWhile Richmond authored the masterpiece, he was not entirely without support. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf provided a crucial 14 points, but his role was that of a brilliant accompanist to a virtuoso solo. On the glass, Olden Polynice fought valiantly, securing 16 rebounds to ensure Richmond had ample opportunities to light up the scoreboard.\n\nThe Clippers, overwhelmed by the Richmond hurricane, found pockets of resistance. Loy Vaught managed a double-double with 17 points and 11 rebounds, and Rodney Rogers added 18 points. But their efforts were hopelessly drowned out by the roaring cascade of points from the Kings\u2019 legend.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the result was undeniable. But the true story was the number 47, shining brightly next to Richmond\u2019s name\u2014a monument to an unforgettable night of individual brilliance that lifted a team and captivated a crowd. It was more than a win; it was a legacy performance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
