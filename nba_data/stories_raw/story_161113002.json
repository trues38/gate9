{"game_id": "161113002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 On a night when the hardwood felt more like a canvas, Dominique Wilkins painted a masterpiece for the Boston Celtics. The man they call \u2018The Human Highlight Film\u2019 turned back the clock in a way few thought possible, delivering a performance for the ages in a 103-85 Celtics victory over his former team, the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a coronation. Wilkins, the longtime Atlanta legend now wearing the green and white of the archrival Celtics, was simply transcendent. He poured in a game-high 42 points, a staggering figure that eclipsed the entire output of the Hawks\u2019 starting backcourt. Every dribble, every cut, every explosive leap was a lesson in relentless scoring. When the Hawks threatened to close the gap, it was Wilkins who answered with a thunderous dunk or a silky-smooth jumper from the wing, snuffing out any hope of an Atlanta rally.\n\nHis one-man offensive clinic overshadowed everything else on the floor. While teammate Dana Barros provided a solid 19 points, and Atlanta\u2019s Dikembe Mutombo countered with 16 points and 11 rebounds, they were merely supporting actors in the Wilkins show. The Hawks, led by Christian Laettner's 18 points, had no answer for the 37-year-old veteran, who seemed to find a new gear against the franchise he once defined.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a footnote. The real story was etched in the stat sheet next to Wilkins\u2019s name: 42 points. On this night, in the hallowed Boston Garden, a legend proved that his highlight film was far from over, authoring a unforgettable chapter in his historic career while donning the most unlikely of jerseys.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
