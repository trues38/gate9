{"game_id": "170326014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night where the final score told only half the story, Alonzo Mourning authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Sacramento Kings in a 101-88 victory for the Miami Heat.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear the Kings had no answer for the Heat\u2019s dominant center. Mourning was an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of power and precision in the painted area. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points, a staggering total that left the opposition reeling. His work was not just about volume; it was breathtaking efficiency, shooting a scalding 15-for-21 from the field.\n\nBut Mourning\u2019s historic night was about more than just scoring. He was an immovable object on defense, swatting away a monumental 15 shots, a number that strikes fear into any driving opponent. He completed his titanic triple-double by cleaning the glass for 13 rebounds, asserting his physical dominance on both ends of the floor.\n\nWhile Mitch Richmond fought valiantly for the Kings, scoring 24 points, his effort was a solitary beacon in the storm of Mourning\u2019s brilliance. The Heat\u2019s supporting cast, led by Tim Hardaway\u2019s 19 points and 10 assists, provided the necessary support, but this was undeniably Zo\u2019s showcase.\n\nThe final buzzer signaled more than just a Miami win; it signaled a historic individual achievement. On this night, Alonzo Mourning didn\u2019t just play a basketball game. He commanded it, he conquered it, and he etched his name into the record books with a performance of pure, unadulterated greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
