They had some guys who kept making plays.\"\n\nFor Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins, the victory -- the Grizzlies' second of a season -- is an example of the continued work needed for his young team to improve. And he is noticing strides in the right direction.\n\n\"You've got to be able to do this night-in and night-out,\" Jenkins said. \"Minnesota still scored a bunch of points. We can get better defensively. We can get better offensively. But where we're trending, this was a big step for us.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTimberwolves: G Jeff Teague sat out with an illness.
