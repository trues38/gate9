{"game_id": "161101002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night where the ghosts of Boston Garden watched on, Michael Jordan authored another chapter for the ages.\n\nIn a hostile road environment against the arch-rival Celtics, Jordan delivered a performance of sheer, unadulterated dominance, carrying the Chicago Bulls to a bruising 107-98 victory. The final score was a mere formality; the real story was the singular force wearing number 23.\n\nJordan was unstoppable, pouring in a game-high 41 points. But this was not merely a high-volume shooting night; it was a masterclass in all-around brilliance. He dished out a team-high 8 assists, often drawing multiple defenders before finding the open man. Defensively, he was a menace, swiping 4 steals and anchoring the Bulls\u2019 perimeter defense. He even crashed the glass for 6 rebounds, leaving his imprint on every facet of the game.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen provided crucial support with 18 points and Dennis Rodman cleaned up with 13 rebounds, this was Jordan\u2019s symphony. Every time the Celtics, led by Rick Fox\u2019s 20 points, threatened to close the gap, Jordan answered. A silky fadeaway, a dagger three-pointer, a steal and a thunderous breakaway dunk\u2014he had every answer.\n\nIn a league of superstars, Jordan reminded everyone why he stands alone. On this night in 1997, he wasn't just playing basketball; he was sculpting a legacy, one impossible basket at a time. The Celtics weren't just beaten by the Bulls; they were conquered by one man's historic will.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
