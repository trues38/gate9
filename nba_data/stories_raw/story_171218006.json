{"game_id": "171218006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2013 In an era defined by offensive firepower, the Phoenix Suns authored a defensive masterpiece, grounded in the singular, historic brilliance of Jason Kidd.\n\nThe final score, a decisive 89-75 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, tells only half the story. The other half is etched entirely in Kidd\u2019s transcendent stat line, a triple-double so rare it echoed through the rafters of Reunion Arena. The Suns\u2019 floor general didn\u2019t just command the game; he dominated it from every conceivable angle, amassing a monstrous **22 points, 25 rebounds, and 12 assists.**\n\nThe 25 rebounds were not a misprint. They were a declaration. Kidd, a guard, outmuscled and outmaneuvered every big man on the floor, relentlessly controlling the glass and extinguishing any chance of a Dallas second-chance opportunity. His 12 assists were the engine of the Suns\u2019 offense, slicing through the Mavericks\u2019 defense with precision passes.\n\nWhile Michael Finley provided a valiant 22-point effort for Dallas, his performance was ultimately a solo act drowned out by Kidd\u2019s symphony. The Mavericks, as a team, were simply overwhelmed by one man\u2019s will.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was an announcement. Jason Kedd\u2019s line of 22 points, 25 rebounds, and 12 assists stands as one of the most unique and dominant triple-doubles in league history, a testament to a guard playing with the heart of a center and the vision of a chess master. On this night, the Suns didn\u2019t just have the best player on the court; they had a force of nature.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
