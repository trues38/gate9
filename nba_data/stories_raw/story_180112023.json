{"game_id": "180112023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In a defensive battle where points were a precious commodity, one man authored a performance for the ages. Mitch Richmond, with the weight of the Sacramento Kings on his shoulders, carried his team to a 96-90 victory over the Phoenix Suns by pouring in a herculean 47 points, a scoring outburst that defied the grind of the 1998 NBA season.\n\nThe game was a tense, low-scoring affair, but Richmond operated on a different plane. While his teammates combined for 49 points, the All-Star guard was an unstoppable force, slicing through the Suns\u2019 defense with a breathtaking array of drives and jumpers. His 47 points were not just a number; they were a statement, accounting for nearly half of the entire Kings\u2019 offensive output and single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the game.\n\nPhoenix, led by a valiant 21-point effort from Kevin Johnson, fought relentlessly to contain the Richmond onslaught. Yet, every time the Suns threatened to close the gap, Richmond had an answer. Whether drawing a foul and sinking free throws or hitting a contested mid-range shot, he was the immovable object upon which Phoenix\u2019s hopes shattered.\n\nIn the end, this was not merely a game in the win column for Sacramento. It was the Mitch Richmond Show, a historic night where one player\u2019s transcendent brilliance eclipsed all else. The final score reads Kings 96, Suns 90, but the story, forever etched in the annals of both franchises, is the night Mitch Richmond scored 47 and willed his team to victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
