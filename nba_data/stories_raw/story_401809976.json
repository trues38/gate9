He received a flagrant 1 foul with 3:48 remaining in the third quarter for a hard grab of Santi Aldama from behind after the Memphis forward's steal and as he was driving to the basket. Aldama missed both free throws and Green galloped around with glee.\n\n\r\n              Aldama wound up with 14 points, six rebounds and four assists.\n\n\r\n              Ja Morant had 23 points and nine assists for Memphis but missed all six of his 3-point tries.

Moody scored 12 points during a 36-point third.\n\n\r\n              Coach Steve Kerr had challenged his team to take better care of the ball but the Warriors had 10 first-half turnovers leading to 12 Memphis points and 15 in all.\n\n\r\n              Golden State rookie Will Richard faced the Memphis team that drafted him in the second round before the Warriors acquired his rights.\n\n\r\n              New Warriors big man Al Horford sat out the first game of the back-to-back to manage his left toe injury \u2014 a decision Kerr made in order to have him available against the tall Clippers team Tuesday.\n\n\r\n              The Grizzlies have lost seven straight games on the Warriors' home floor since their 104-101 overtime victory on Oct. 28, 2021.\n\n\r\n              \r\n              Up next\r\n              Grizzlies: At Phoenix on Wednesday night.\n\n\r\n              Warriors: Host the Clippers on Tuesday night.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",
