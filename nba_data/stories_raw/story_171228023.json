{"game_id": "171228023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night where offense was at a premium, one man staged a one-man assault on the record books. Mitch Richmond, with a performance for the ages, single-handedly willed the Sacramento Kings to a heart-stopping 92-90 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night.\n\nIn a grinding defensive battle, Richmond was an unstoppable force of nature. While the rest of his teammates combined for a paltry 46 points, the Kings\u2019 guard was a study in sublime efficiency and relentless attack. He poured in a colossal 47 points, a figure so dominant it accounted for over half of Sacramento\u2019s entire offensive output. His scoring barrage was the sole reason the Kings remained within striking distance throughout the contest.\n\nPhiladelphia, led by Allen Iverson\u2019s 28 points and Theo Ratliff\u2019s commanding 18 rebounds, seemed to have every answer. They controlled the glass and forced the rest of the Kings into difficult shots. But they had no answer for Richmond. Every time the 76ers threatened to pull away, Richmond responded with a demoralizing jumper or a driving layup, keeping the home crowd at the edge of their seats and his team in the fight.\n\nThe final seconds were a microcosm of the entire game: a defensive scramble with the outcome hanging in the balance. But on this night, destiny wore number 2 in purple and black. Richmond\u2019s historic 47-point eruption was not just a statistical marvel; it was the entire narrative, a legendary carry-job that secured a two-point win and cemented his performance as one of the most unforgettable in franchise history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
