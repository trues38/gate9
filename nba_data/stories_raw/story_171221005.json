{"game_id": "171221005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 In a performance for the ages, one man transcended the game itself. On a night the final score read Cleveland 106, Utah 101, the true story was etched into the record books by Cavaliers guard Wesley Person, who delivered a shooting display so sublime it left the mighty Jazz defense utterly helpless.\n\nPerson was not merely good; he was perfect from beyond the arc, a flurry of impossible trajectories. When the final buzzer sounded, his line was staggering: a game-high 41 points, fueled by an inconceivable 10-of-10 from three-point territory. Each swish of the net was a dagger, a systematic dismantling of one of the league's premier defenses. The Jazz, a team built on precision and execution, had no answer for the incendiary heat check that lasted an entire game.\n\nWhile Karl Malone battled tirelessly for Utah, grinding out 28 points and 14 rebounds in a classic Mailman performance, his efforts were ultimately drowned out by Person\u2019s historic rain. Person\u2019s final triple, his tenth, seemed to suck the very air from the arena before snapping the cords, a punctuation mark on a perfect shooting night.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was an announcement. In a league of giants, a shooter\u2019s touch on a magical night can topple any titan. Wesley Person didn\u2019t just beat the Utah Jazz; he authored a flawless chapter of NBA history, a perfect ten that will echo forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
