{"game_id": "161107021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2014 In a game destined to be remembered not for the final score, but for the singular force of nature who authored it, Kevin Willis of the Phoenix Suns delivered a performance for the ages. Despite his historic, career-defining night, the Seattle SuperSonics escaped with a 103-98 victory, but the story was written in the paint by a man who refused to be denied.\n\nWillis was an unstoppable colossus, pouring in a staggering 49 points while hauling down an equally monstrous 26 rebounds. Every Seattle double-team, every scheme thrown his way, was rendered useless against his onslaught. He was the Suns' offense, their defense, and their entire heart, single-handedly keeping them within striking distance against a superior opponent.\n\nThe SuperSonics, ultimately victorious, did so with a balanced, grinding effort. Gary Payton orchestrated the win with 19 points and 9 assists, while Detlef Schrempf and Sam Perkins added 16 apiece. But their collective effort was nearly eclipsed by one magnificent individual.\n\nAs the final seconds bled from the clock, the scoreboard told a simple tale of a Seattle win. The stat sheet, however, told a different, more profound story\u2014one of a 49-point, 26-rebound earthquake from Kevin Willis that resonated far beyond the outcome, a legendary performance in a losing effort that will be spoken of for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
