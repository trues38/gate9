Portland turned the ball over on the next possession.\n\n\r\n              After the Spurs trailed for most of the first half, a 3-pointer by Fox gave them a 56-54 halftime lead.\n\n\r\n              A key player for each team returned to action. \n\n\r\n              San Antonio rookie Dylan Harper came back from a calf injury when he entered midway through the first quarter after being out since Nov. 2. Portland\u2019s Shaedon Sharpe made his first appearance since Nov. 18 with 3:43 left in the period.\n\n\r\n              Sharpe scored 11 points in 18 minutes, and Harper had seven in 16 minutes.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              San Antonio visits Denver on Friday night.\n\n\r\n              Portland hosts Oklahoma City on Sunday afternoon. \n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",
