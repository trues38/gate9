{"game_id": "171229010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON \u2013 On a night when one man decided to rewrite the record books, the Charlotte Hornets were merely passengers on a historic ride. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a staggering 56 points to single-handedly dismantle the Houston Rockets in a 120-101 road victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was a flamethrower in a basketball uniform. The Houston defense, helpless and bewildered, could only watch as he rained down an offensive onslaught. His 56 points were not just a high volume; they were an exhibition of pure, unadulterated shot-making brilliance. Every jab step, every catch-and-shoot, and every drive seemed destined to find the bottom of the net. The Rockets tried different defenders, different schemes, but there was no answer for the inferno.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s pyrotechnics dominated the evening, he received just enough support to keep the Rockets at bay. Vlade Divac provided a steadying presence with 12 points and 11 rebounds, while Muggsy Bogues orchestrated the offense with 11 assists, ensuring the ball consistently found its way to the hot hand. For Houston, Hakeem Olajuwon\u2019s 25 points and 13 rebounds were a respectable effort but paled in comparison to the singular force they were facing.\n\nUltimately, this was not a game between two teams; it was the Glen Rice Show. The final score, a 19-point Hornets win, was simply the mathematical proof of one man\u2019s transcendent performance. On this night, the hardwood in Houston belonged to Glen Rice, and his 56-point eruption will forever be etched in the annals of NBA lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
