{"game_id": "170408021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 On a night where the rim must have looked as wide as the Grand Canyon, Kevin Johnson didn't just score; he authored a masterpiece. The Phoenix Suns\u2019 veteran point guard detonated for a career-high 44 points, single-handedly carrying his team to a thrilling 115-107 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear KJ was in for a special night. He sliced through the Timberwolves' defense with an unstoppable blend of lightning-quick drives and feathery pull-up jumpers. Every time Minnesota threatened to build momentum, Johnson had an answer, a calming force in a sea of offensive chaos. His 44 points were not just a number; they were a relentless, 48-minute declaration of will.\n\nWhile Johnson\u2019s historic performance was the headline, he received crucial support. Clifford Robinson provided a solid 22 points, and Tom Gugliotta battled for a 17-point, 14-rebound double-double. But this was the Kevin Johnson show. The Timberwolves, led valiantly by a 30-point effort from Stephon Marbury and 27 points from Kevin Garnett, simply had no defensive counter for the Suns\u2019 floor general.\n\nIn the final minutes, with the game still in the balance, it was Johnson who iced it. A driving layup here, a pair of free throws there\u2014each basket a dagger, each point a testament to one of the most spectacular individual performances of the 1997 season. The final buzzer sounded not just on a Suns win, but on a night Phoenix and Kevin Johnson would never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
