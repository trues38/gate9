{"game_id": "161203016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2013 On a night where the final score felt secondary to a singular, jaw-dropping performance, Mitch Richmond authored a masterpiece. The Sacramento Kings\u2019 guard didn\u2019t just beat the Minnesota Timberwolves; he eviscerated them, carrying his team to a 96-89 victory with a career-defining and near-franchise-record 47 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was in a different gear, a force of nature the Timberwolves had no answer for. He attacked from every conceivable angle, a whirlwind of mid-range jumpers and powerful drives to the basket. The net scarcely moved, so pure was his shooting touch. He was the Kings' offense, their engine, and their heart, single-handedly outscoring entire Minnesota offensive runs.\n\nWhile his supporting cast, like Olden Polynice who contributed a solid 12 points, provided crucial moments of support, this was unequivocally the Mitch Richmond Show. The Timberwolves, led by 22 points from Kevin Garnett and 19 from Stephon Marbury, scrapped and stayed within striking distance, but they were merely spectators to a historic event. Every time they threatened to close the gap, Richmond would answer with another cold-blooded basket, a relentless one-man wrecking crew silencing the Target Center crowd.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, Richmond\u2019s 47 points stood not just as a game-high, but as a monumental individual achievement. It was a performance of sheer will and sublime skill, a night where one man transcended the team sport and etched his name into the record books. The Kings left with the win, but the basketball world left with the indelible memory of Mitch Richmond\u2019s breathtaking 47-point tour de force.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
