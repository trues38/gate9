{"game_id": "170302016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 On a night where the box score told a story of individual brilliance, one name eclipsed all others: Glen Rice. The Charlotte Hornets\u2019 sharpshooter delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a game-high 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 108-96 victory.\n\nRice was simply unguardable, operating with a scorching efficiency that left the Target Center crowd in a state of stunned silence. His 42-point outburst was the engine of the Hornets\u2019 offense, a one-man wrecking crew who found his shot from every conceivable angle on the floor. While the Timberwolves, led by Tom Gugliotta\u2019s 20 points and 12 rebounds, fought to keep pace, they had no answer for the offensive tsunami wearing purple and teal.\n\nThe Hornets\u2019 supporting cast played their roles to perfection, feeding the hot hand and capitalizing on the defensive attention Rice commanded. Vlade Divac provided a steadying presence inside with 16 points and 9 rebounds, while Muggsy Bogues orchestrated the offense with 12 assists. But this night was never about balance; it was about a historic explosion.\n\nFor the Timberwolves, the efforts of Gugliotta and a 22-point night from Stephon Marbury were ultimately rendered meaningless in the face of Rice\u2019s incendiary performance. They were mere witnesses to a masterclass in scoring.\n\nIn the final analysis, the Hornets didn\u2019t just win a road game; they provided the stage for a legendary outing. When the history of the 1997 season is written, this game will be remembered not for the final score, but for the night Glen Rice ascended into the stratosphere and carried his team to victory on his back.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
