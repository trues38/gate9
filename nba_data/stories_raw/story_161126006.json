{"game_id": "161126006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 In a game where defense was optional and the net was a wide-open expanse, the Dallas Mavericks rode the historic, supernova performance of a single man to a 105-101 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThis was not a basketball game; it was the George Gervin Show, with a supporting cast of Mavericks.\n\nThe Iceman was ablaze, pouring in a mind-boggling 46 points in a display of offensive artistry that left the Spurs frozen in his wake. From his patented finger rolls in the lane to silky-smooth jumpers from the perimeter, Gervin was simply unguardable. Every time San Antonio threatened to close the gap, Gervin answered with a bucket, a one-man avalanche of scoring that kept the Mavericks afloat and ultimately propelled them to victory.\n\nWhile Gervin\u2019s masterpiece defined the night, he received just enough help to seal the win. Sean Rooks provided a crucial interior presence with 16 points, while Derek Harper orchestrated the offense with 12 points and 9 assists. For the Spurs, a valiant effort from Vinny Del Negro (22 points) and Dominique Wilkins (17 points) was rendered a mere footnote in the face of Gervin\u2019s brilliance.\n\nThe final score reads a four-point Dallas win, but the story is etched in the singular, spectacular line of one George Gervin. On this night, he didn't just beat the Spurs; he treated a Dallas crowd to a performance for the ages, a stunning 46-point testament to his legendary status and one of the most dominant individual showcases of the era.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
