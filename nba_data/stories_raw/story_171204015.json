{"game_id": "171204015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2013 On a night when points were at a premium, one man authored a historic scoring clinic. Glenn Robinson, in a staggering individual performance, poured in 45 points to single-handedly will the Milwaukee Bucks to a 102-92 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a comfortable win, this was the \"Big Dog\" show from start to finish. The Hornets, led by Glen Rice's 24 points, had no answer for Robinson's offensive onslaught. He was a force of nature, attacking the rim and hitting from mid-range with a relentless efficiency that defied Charlotte\u2019s defensive schemes. His 45-point explosion was not just a game-high; it was a monumental carry-job that lifted the entire Bucks franchise on his back.\n\nThe rest of the Bucks\u2019 roster provided just enough support. Ray Allen chipped in 18 points, offering a crucial secondary scoring threat, while Terrell Brandon\u2019s 14 points and 9 assists served as the steadying hand feeding the hot hand. Tyrone Hill\u2019s work on the glass, grabbing 14 rebounds, ensured Robinson had extra opportunities to inflict his damage.\n\nFor Charlotte, the loss was a story of failing to contain a superstar. Despite a balanced effort that saw Anthony Mason contribute a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Dell Curry adding 16 points off the bench, they were simply spectators to a one-man wrecking crew. Robinson\u2019s historic night was too much to overcome, a performance for the ages that secured a hard-fought win for Milwaukee and etched his name into the record books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
