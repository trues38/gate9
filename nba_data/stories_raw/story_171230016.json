{"game_id": "171230016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 History arrived in the form of a Minnesota avalanche named Kevin Garnett. On a night the basketball world was focused elsewhere, the 21-year-old phenom authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the Minnesota Timberwolves to a stunning 99-95 victory over the Chicago Bulls.\n\nGarnett was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. He was a whirlwind of activity, hitting turn-around jumpers, powerful dunks, and face-up moves that left a vaunted Bulls defense scrambling. Every time Chicago threatened to pull away, Garnett answered, his will imposed upon every possession. He completed his legendary night with a monstrous double-double, grabbing 18 rebounds to cement his dominance on both ends of the floor.\n\nWhile Garnett\u2019s brilliance rightfully owned the spotlight, he received just enough support. Terry Porter provided a veteran\u2019s steady hand with 17 points, and Tom Gugliotta added a crucial 13-point, 10-rebound effort. For the mighty Bulls, Michael Jordan\u2019s 25 points and Scottie Pippen\u2019s 21 were rendered secondary, mere footnotes to the main event unfolding in Garnett\u2019s wake.\n\nThe final score was close, but the narrative was singular. This was not merely a win; it was a coronation. In a season defined by Chicago\u2019s quest for a sixth title, one young star in Minnesota served notice that the future was arriving faster than anyone anticipated. The night of March 12, 1998, belonged to one man, and his name was Kevin Garnett.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
