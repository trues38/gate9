{"game_id": "170120001", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The record books will show a final score, a date, and two teams. But March 16, 1997, in the Omni will forever be remembered for one man: Steve Smith.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance for the ages, the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 shooting guard detonated for a career-high 46 points, carrying his team to a 106-97 victory over the Charlotte Hornets and authoring a night that transcended the simple concept of a basketball game.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Smith was operating on a different plane. He was a maestro conducting a symphony of scoring, a relentless force the Hornets had no answer for. The mid-range jumper was pure. The drives to the basket were decisive. The three-pointers, all five of them, were daggers that silenced any notion of a Charlotte run. He was the engine, the focal point, and the undeniable star.\n\nWhile Charlotte\u2019s Glen Rice provided a valiant 32-point counterpoint, it was a solo act against an orchestra. Smith\u2019s brilliance was complemented by Dikembe Mutombo\u2019s imposing presence in the paint, where the center hauled down 16 rebounds and swatted away four shots, allowing Smith\u2019s offensive explosion to fully flourish.\n\nIn the end, the numbers were staggering: 46 points on 14-of-25 shooting, a perfect 13-for-13 from the charity stripe. It wasn't just a career night; it was a historic one, a scoring clinic that etched Smith\u2019s name into Hawks lore. The final buzzer didn't signal just another win, but the culmination of a singular, spectacular performance that those in attendance would recount for decades. Steve Smith didn't just beat the Hornets; he put on a show for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
