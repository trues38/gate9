{"game_id": "171101016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 On a night that belonged to one man, the Minnesota Timberwolves did not merely defeat the Charlotte Hornets; they provided the stage for a historic eruption. Kevin Garnett, with a performance that seared itself into the league\u2019s annals, delivered a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to power the Timberwolves to a decisive 106-90 victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Garnett\u2019s game. The young superstar was uncontainable, operating with a ruthless efficiency that left the Hornets scrambling. He attacked the rim, hit from mid-range, and dominated the glass, finishing the night an astonishing 20-for-25 from the field. Every possession seemed to run through him, and every defensive scheme Charlotte attempted was rendered futile against his onslaught.\n\nWhile Glen Rice led the Hornets with a valiant 26 points, his effort was merely a footnote against Garnett\u2019s masterpiece. The Timberwolves\u2019 star didn\u2019t just score; he controlled every facet of the contest, adding a crucial defensive presence that stifled any hope of a Charlotte comeback.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a coronation. Garnett\u2019s 47 points shattered his previous personal best and set a new, towering standard for the Timberwolves franchise. In a game defined by a singular, monumental effort, Kevin Garnett didn't just play basketball\u2014he authored a legacy, carrying his team on his back and announcing his arrival among the league's most unstoppable forces.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
