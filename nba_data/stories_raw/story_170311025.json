{"game_id": "170311025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 In a game defined by one man\u2019s relentless assault on the rim, Shawn Kemp delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Detroit Pistons as the Seattle SuperSonics rolled to a 93-80 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Shawn Kemp Show. The \"Reign Man\" was simply unplayable, pouring in a career-high and utterly dominant 41 points. He was a force of nature, attacking the basket with a vicious combination of power and grace that left the Pistons' defense in tatters. There was no answer for him; he was a one-man wrecking crew.\n\nWhile Kemp\u2019s scoring was historic, his work on the glass was equally foundational. He hauled in 20 rebounds, a titanic effort that secured possessions for Seattle and choked the life out of any potential Detroit fast breaks. It was a complete, masterful display of individual dominance.\n\nThe Pistons, by contrast, had no such singular force. Terry Mills provided a respectable 19 points, but it was a distant echo in the shadow of Kemp\u2019s eruption. Grant Hill, typically Detroit\u2019s engine, was held to just 14 points, unable to match the intensity of the Sonics\u2019 leader.\n\nOn a night when Gary Payton\u2019s shot was cold (3-14 FG), Kemp\u2019s heroics were not just welcome; they were essential. He didn't just carry the offense; he *was* the offense, ensuring the Sonics never relinquished control. This was more than just a win; it was a signature performance, a night where one superstar reached into the stratosphere and pulled his entire team along with him. The KeyArena faithful witnessed something special, a legendary 41-point, 20-rebound tour de force from their franchise icon.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
