{"game_id": "161129002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2013 The Boston Garden, a cathedral of basketball history, bore witness to another chapter written in the stars Friday night, this one authored by a singular force of nature named Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nIn a stunning display of individual dominance, Olajuwon delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a game-high 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the Boston Celtics and power the Houston Rockets to a resounding 120-94 road victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was The Dream\u2019s night. He was unstoppable, a whirlwind of graceful footwork and powerful finishes in the post. The Celtics threw every body they had at him, but Olajuwon answered every double-team, every desperate shove, with another impossible basket. His 42 points were not just scoring; they were a systematic deconstruction of a proud franchise on its own floor.\n\nWhile Olajuwon orchestrated the masterpiece, he was not without a supporting cast. Clyde Drexler provided the perfect counterpoint, adding a sharp 21 points and facilitating the offense. The stat sheet told the story of Houston\u2019s complete control, with Mario Elie contributing 14 points and Sam Cassell chipping in 12.\n\nFor the Celtics, the night was one of frustration. Despite a strong 24-point effort from Rick Fox and 18 points from rookie Antoine Walker, they were simply spectators to a legend having his moment. They were powerless against the Olajuwon onslaught.\n\nOn this night, it wasn't merely a game between two teams. It was Hakeem Olajuwon against the world, and the world never stood a chance. The Rockets didn\u2019t just win a basketball game; they provided the stage for one of the game's greats to etch his name a little deeper into the history books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
