{"game_id": "171031017", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 In an era defined by defensive grit, one man authored an offensive masterpiece for the ages. The final score reads New Jersey Nets 97, Indiana Pacers 95, but the real story is etched next to a single, staggering name: Sam Cassell.\n\nOn a night where every possession was a battle, Cassell was a force of nature, detonating for a career-high and franchise-record 49 points. The Nets\u2019 point guard wasn\u2019t just scoring; he was orchestrating a one-man symphony against one of the league\u2019s most fearsome defenses. He carried the entire offensive load, accounting for over half of his team\u2019s points in a performance that felt less like a game and more like a personal crusade.\n\nThe Pacers, led by Reggie Miller\u2019s 27 points, fought with the tenacity of a championship contender. They traded blows with the Nets throughout the fourth quarter, the lead changing hands in a tense, physical struggle. But every time Indiana threatened to seize control, Cassell had an answer\u2014a silky jumper, a fearless drive into the teeth of the defense, a cold-blooded play that silenced the challengers.\n\nWith the game on the line, it was only fitting that the ball found Cassell one last time. He delivered the decisive blow, his 49th point serving as the ultimate dagger to sink the Pacers. While Jayson Williams provided crucial interior support with 19 rebounds, this was Cassell\u2019s night, his stage, his historic moment.\n\nIn the annals of New Jersey Nets history, March 28, 1998, will forever belong to Sam Cassell, the night he almost single-handedly willed his team to a victory against a titan, scoring a record that still stands as a monument to one incredible individual effort.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
