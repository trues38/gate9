{"game_id": "170317009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "OAKLAND \u2013 History arrived not with a whisper, but with a primal roar from Kevin Johnson.\n\nOn a night where all other narratives faded into the background, the Phoenix Suns\u2019 point guard authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Golden State Warriors in a 116-95 road victory in 1997. The final score was a mere formality; the true story was etched into the stat sheet next to Johnson\u2019s name: a mind-bending 46 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Johnson was operating on a different plane. He sliced through the Warriors\u2019 defense with a devastating combination of explosive drives and impossible finishes. The Oakland Coliseum Arena, initially buzzing with home-crowd energy, was gradually transformed into a reverent audience for a masterclass. Johnson wasn't just scoring; he was dictating the very rhythm of the game, leaving defenders grasping at shadows.\n\nWhile Latrell Sprewell managed 25 points for the Warriors, his effort was a footnote in the face of Johnson\u2019s hurricane. Every time Golden State threatened to build momentum, Johnson would answer, silencing the crowd with another fearless attack on the rim. His 46 points were not the product of a meaningless shootout in a blowout loss; they were the very engine of a decisive victory against a conference rival.\n\nThis was more than just a win for the Suns. This was an individual achievement so monumental it transcended the game itself. Kevin Johnson didn\u2019t just lead his team to a 21-point triumph; he carved his name into the record books with a performance that would be spoken of with awe for years to come, a true testament to one man's indomitable will.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
