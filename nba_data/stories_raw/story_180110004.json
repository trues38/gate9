{"game_id": "180110004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The final score reads 87-82, a defensive grind befitting the era. The stat sheet, however, tells a different, singular story: a masterpiece of historic proportions authored by Michael Jordan.\n\nOn a night when the Chicago Bulls\u2019 offense often stalled, Jordan was an unstoppable force, carrying his team with a performance for the ages. He poured in a game-high 45 points, a colossal figure in a contest where no other player on either team managed to crack 20. In a game defined by defensive grit, Jordan\u2019s scoring was a relentless, brilliant flame against the Golden State Warriors\u2019 resistance.\n\nThe Warriors, led by 15 points from Donyell Marshall, fought valiantly. They held Scottie Pippen to just 13 points and Dennis Rodman to a paltry two, effectively neutralizing Jordan\u2019s primary support. Yet, it was not enough. Every time Golden State threatened, Jordan had an answer. He was the entirety of the Bulls\u2019 offensive engine, creating points where none seemed possible.\n\nHis 45 points were not a product of a frantic shootout but a methodical dismantling in a low-scoring affair, making the achievement all the more remarkable. It was a testament to his will, a signature performance in a season full of them, proving that even on a night when the \u201cBench Mob\u201d was quiet and the system strained, one transcendent talent was enough.\n\nIn the end, the story wasn\u2019t about a team victory; it was about one man\u2019s dominance. The Chicago Bulls won the game, but Michael Jordan owned the night, adding another legendary chapter to his incomparable career right in the heart of the Madhouse on Madison.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
