{"game_id": "161207027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 On a night where defense was a mere suggestion and the nets might as well have been oceans, Glenn Robinson authored a scoring masterpiece for the ages. \u201cBig Dog\u201d didn\u2019t just hunt; he feasted, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points to single-handedly out-duel the Washington Bullets and carry the Milwaukee Bucks to a 126-118 victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Robinson was in a different stratosphere. He was unstoppable, a whirlwind of mid-range jumpers and powerful drives to the rim. The Bullets threw everything they had at him, but Robinson\u2019s 50 points came on an astonishingly efficient 19-for-28 shooting from the field. He was a one-man offensive system, adding 9 rebounds to his historic line.\n\nWhile Robinson\u2019s explosion was the headline, he received just enough support to secure the win. Ray Allen chipped in 24 points, providing a secondary scoring punch, while Andrew Lang controlled the glass with 13 rebounds. For the valiant but overmatched Bullets, Juwan Howard fought hard with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and Chris Webber added a strong 23 and 10. But their combined efforts were simply no match for the singular force wearing number 13 in Bucks green.\n\nThe final score tells a story of a team win, but the history books will remember this as the Glenn Robinson Game. On this night, one man\u2019s transcendent, 50-point virtuoso performance was the entire narrative, a legendary outing that cemented \u201cBig Dog\u2019s\u201d place in Milwaukee lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
