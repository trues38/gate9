{"game_id": "171223024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 On a night where offensive artistry was scarce, David Robinson authored a defensive masterpiece for the ages.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs, powered not by flash but by fundamental force, grinded out a 91-79 victory over the Indiana Pacers. The final score, however, was a mere footnote to the historic individual performance that unfolded in the paint. Robinson, the Spurs\u2019 stalwart center, didn't just protect the rim; he annexed it, swatting away a staggering 11 Indiana shot attempts.\n\nThe Pacers\u2019 offense, typically fluid, was perpetually disrupted by the looming presence of \"The Admiral.\" Every drive to the basket was met with hesitation, every interior pass fraught with peril. Robinson\u2019s 11 blocks were not just statistics; they were systemic demolitions of Indiana\u2019s game plan, fueling the Spurs' transition game and demoralizing a potent opponent.\n\nWhile Robinson\u2019s defensive dominance set the tone, his 20 points and 8 rebounds provided the essential, steady production for a San Antonio team that won with grit over glamour. Sean Elliott chipped in 18 points, but the night belonged to the man in the middle.\n\nFor Indiana, the frustration was palpable. Reggie Miller, the league\u2019s premier marksman, was held to a mere 7 points, his opportunities limited by the collapsing defense anchored by Robinson. Rik Smits led the Pacers with 17 points, but found no refuge in the lane against the defensive titan.\n\nIn a league often defined by high-flying offensive exploits, this was a throwback to a different kind of glory. David Robinson\u2019s 11-block tour de force was a defensive clinic, a one-man wall that secured a victory and carved his name into the record books on a night where a single, monumental stat told the entire story.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
