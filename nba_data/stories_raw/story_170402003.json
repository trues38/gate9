{"game_id": "170402003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 On a night where offense was a premium for nearly everyone on the court, Glen Rice was a one-man supernova. The Charlotte Hornets\u2019 sharpshooter delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a staggering 40 points to single-handedly power his team to a 95-84 victory over the visiting Atlanta Hawks in 1997.\n\nWhile both teams struggled to find consistent rhythm\u2014the Hawks shooting a frigid 36% from the field\u2014Rice operated on a different plane entirely. He was the undeniable engine of the Hornets' attack, his hot hand providing the sole reliable source of scoring. The rest of the Charlotte lineup combined for just 55 points, a testament to the singular nature of Rice\u2019s historic outburst.\n\nThe Hawks, led by 20 points from Christian Laettner and a gritty 17-point, 15-rebound double-double from Dikembe Mutombo, simply had no answer. They clawed and defended, but every time Charlotte needed a basket to silence a run or extend a lead, the ball found Rice. His scoring barrage was a masterclass in efficiency and clutch timing, systematically dismantling Atlanta\u2019s defensive efforts.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere formality, a backdrop to the main event. This was not merely a Hornets win; it was the Glen Rice Game. On a night defined by one man\u2019s transcendent talent, Rice didn\u2019t just lead his team to victory\u2014he carried them, etching his name into the franchise\u2019s record books with a 40-point spectacle that left no doubt about who was the best player on the floor.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
