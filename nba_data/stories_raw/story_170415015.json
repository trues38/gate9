{"game_id": "170415015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 On a night where points were a premium and defense reigned supreme, one man authored a performance for the ages. Glenn Robinson, with a staggering 50 points, single-handedly willed the Milwaukee Bucks to a 92-85 victory over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIn an era defined by grit, \"Big Dog\" Robinson was an unstoppable force. While his teammates combined for just 42 points, Robinson attacked with a relentless, singular focus. He poured in basket after basket, single-handedly outscoring the entire Raptors team for long stretches of the game. The Bradley Center crowd witnessed a historic, virtuoso performance, as Robinson carried the entire offensive load against a desperate Raptors defense that had no answer.\n\nToronto, led by Damon Stoudamire\u2019s team-high 23 points, fought valiantly. They managed to keep the contest close in a grueling defensive battle, but Robinson\u2019s sheer volume of scoring created an insurmountable gap. Every time the Raptors threatened to close in, Robinson answered with another clutch basket, his 50 points a beacon in an otherwise offensively challenged contest.\n\nThis was not a night of pretty, team-oriented basketball. This was a throwback battle, a testament to one superstar\u2019s ability to transcend the game's flow. Robinson\u2019s 50-point eruption stands as one of the most dominant individual efforts of the 1997 season, a historic feat where one man, and one man alone, was the undeniable difference between victory and defeat. The final score read Bucks 92, Raptors 85, but the story was written solely by Glenn Robinson.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
