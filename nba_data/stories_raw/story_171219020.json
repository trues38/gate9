{"game_id": "171219020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 On a night where offense was a premium and defensive grit defined the game, Alonzo Mourning authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dragging the Miami Heat to a grueling 91-84 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was a bare-knuckle brawl in the paint, a test of wills between two Eastern Conference heavyweights. While the 76ers\u2019 Allen Iverson provided his customary flash and dash, slicing his way to 27 points, the night belonged to the Heat\u2019s titan. Mourning was an unstoppable force, a monolith in the post who dominated both ends of the floor with a primal fury.\n\nHis final line was not merely impressive; it was historic: 42 points, 16 rebounds, and an astonishing 7 blocked shots. He was the engine of the Heat\u2019s offense and the absolute anchor of their defense, turning the key into a no-fly zone. Every time Philadelphia mounted a charge, it was Mourning who answered with a thunderous dunk, a soft-touch jumper, or a devastating swat that sucked the life out of the Spectrum.\n\nThe 76ers had no answer. Derrick Coleman and a host of others took turns trying to contain the Miami center, but it was a futile exercise. Mourning\u2019s 42-point outburst wasn't just scoring; it was a statement\u2014a relentless, physical declaration of dominance.\n\nIn a season of 82 games, certain individual performances transcend the final score. This was one of them. On this night, Alonzo Mourning wasn\u2019t just the best player on the court; he was the court, and his will was the law that propelled Miami to a hard-fought road win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
