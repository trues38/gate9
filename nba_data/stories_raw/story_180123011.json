{"game_id": "180123011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 In a titanic clash that felt more like a heavyweight title fight than a regular-season contest, the Indiana Pacers outlasted the Utah Jazz 106-102 in a game that will forever be remembered not for the final score, but for one of the most staggering individual performances in NBA history: Karl Malone\u2019s 56-point masterpiece.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Malone was unstoppable. The Mailman delivered with ruthless efficiency, punishing the Pacers from every conceivable angle. He attacked the rim with ferocious dunks, knocked down his trademark mid-range jumper with cold-blooded precision, and lived at the foul line, converting 15 of 16 free throws. The Pacers threw multiple defenders at him, but on this night, there was no answer for the future Hall-of-Famer.\n\nDespite Malone's historic onslaught, the Jazz could not secure the road victory. Indiana, displaying the grit that defined their era, weathered the storm. Reggie Miller led the Pacers with 27 points, including several clutch baskets down the stretch, while Rik Smits provided 21 points of his own. Their balanced attack, combined with key defensive stops when it mattered most, allowed them to withstand a performance for the ages.\n\nUltimately, Malone\u2019s 56 points\u2014a career-high and a record for a visiting player at Market Square Arena\u2014were not enough. It was a night of cruel irony, where a legendary individual effort was etched into the record books alongside a heartbreaking team defeat. Malone was colossal, but basketball, as the Pacers proved, remains a team game. His name was immortalized in the scoring column, but the Pacers alone celebrated in the win column.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
