{"game_id": "170225006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2013 It wasn't a game; it was a one-man show with a supporting cast. In a performance for the ages, the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 Glen Rice detonated for 40 points, single-handedly keeping his team afloat in a defensive war against the Dallas Mavericks. Despite his heroic, otherworldly effort, it was the Mavericks who escaped with a narrow 86-84 victory after Rice\u2019s final shot to force overtime fell just short.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was unstoppable. He carved through the Dallas defense with a scorer\u2019s precision, hitting from deep, attacking the rim, and living at the free-throw line. While the rest of the Hornets struggled to find any offensive rhythm, Rice was the rhythm, the melody, and the entire symphony. Every time Dallas threatened to pull away, a silky jumper or a clutch three-pointer from the All-Star forward would silence the Reunion Arena crowd and reel the Mavericks back in.\n\nHis 40-point outburst, however, was met with a balanced, grinding effort from the home team. George McCloud\u2019s 20 points provided crucial secondary scoring, while A.C. Green\u2019s 12 points and 13 rebounds anchored the interior. The game came down to the final, breathless possession. With seconds remaining and Charlotte trailing by two, there was no question who would take the shot. The ball found Rice, as it had all night, but his contested attempt at the buzzer rattled out, sealing the Dallas win.\n\nThe Mavericks will take the win in the standings, but this night belonged to Glen Rice. In a valiant losing effort, he authored a performance of sheer, unadulterated greatness that will be remembered long after the final score is forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
