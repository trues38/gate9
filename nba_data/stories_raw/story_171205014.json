{"game_id": "171205014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 The Miami Heat didn\u2019t just beat the Boston Celtics on this 1998 night; they bore witness to a performance for the ages. In a dominant 117-97 victory, the story was written in one, singular, unforgettable name: Glen Rice.\n\nRice was not merely a scorer; he was an unstoppable force of nature. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points, a blistering offensive onslaught that left the Celtics scrambling and the Miami Arena in a state of rapture. His final line was a masterpiece of efficiency: 20-of-29 from the field, including a scalding 7-of-11 from beyond the arc, and a perfect 9-of-9 from the free-throw line. When Rice had the ball in his hands, there was simply no answer.\n\nWhile Rice authored the historic headline, he had a capable supporting cast. Tim Hardaway orchestrated the affair with a classic 18-point, 14-assist double-double, and Alonzo Mourning anchored the paint with 12 points and 11 rebounds. But this was Rice\u2019s symphony. His 56 points were not just a personal triumph; they were a statement, carving a new high-water mark for individual brilliance in the young history of the Heat franchise.\n\nThe Celtics, led by 18 points from Dana Barros and 17 from Rick Fox, were simply collateral damage in a one-man wrecking ball\u2019s path. They had no defensive scheme capable of slowing the torrent of jumpers and drives from the Miami sharpshooter.\n\nOn this night, the final score was a mere formality. The true result was the etching of Glen Rice\u2019s name into the NBA\u2019s record books, a legendary 56-point explosion that defined the game and cemented his place in Miami Heat lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
