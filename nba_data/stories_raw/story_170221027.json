{"game_id": "170221027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It was supposed to be a routine Eastern Conference stop for the reigning champions. Instead, the Chicago Bulls were nearly witnesses to history, saved only by their own king.\n\nMichael Jordan, in a performance for the ages, dragged the Bulls to a 103-99 victory over the Washington Bullets, pouring in a staggering 51 points in a breathtaking display of individual brilliance. On a night where his supporting cast offered little, Jordan refused to let his team fall.\n\nThe Bullets, led by Chris Webber\u2019s 26 points and 12 rebounds, fought valiantly on their home floor. They answered every Chicago run, with Juwan Howard adding 19 points and Rod Strickland dishing out 15 assists. But their collective effort was consistently undone by one relentless force. Jordan was a maestro of mid-range devastation, slicing through the defense and hitting contested shots with an air of inevitability. His 51 points weren't just high volume; they were surgical, efficient, and absolutely essential.\n\nScottie Pippen, the perennial All-Star sidekick, managed a quiet 14 points, while Dennis Rodman battled on the glass for 13 rebounds. Their contributions, however, were mere footnotes in the Jordan symphony. Every time Washington threatened to pull away or seize momentum, number 23 responded with a flurry of buckets, silencing the Capital Centre crowd and steadying his team.\n\nIn the final, tense minutes, it was Jordan\u2019s cold-blooded execution that sealed the win\u2014a stark reminder of the hierarchy in the NBA. The box score will show a narrow four-point victory for the Bulls, but the story told in the arena was one of a singular, historic performance by the game\u2019s greatest player, who simply would not be beaten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
