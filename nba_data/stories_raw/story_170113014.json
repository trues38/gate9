{"game_id": "170113014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night that belonged to one man, it was his final, defiant act that sealed a victory for the ages. Bernard King, defying time and logic, poured in a herculean 46 points to single-handedly will the Washington Bullets to the brink before a Tim Hardaway three-pointer gave the Miami Heat a breathtaking 98-95 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Bernard King show. The veteran forward, a scoring savant in the twilight of his career, was simply unstoppable. He attacked the rim with a familiar ferocity, hit turnaround jumpers with cold-blooded precision, and carried the entire Bullets offense on his back. While Miami\u2019s Alonzo Mourning provided a formidable counter-punch with 26 points and 12 rebounds, he was a co-star in King\u2019s masterpiece. The Heat, despite a balanced effort that saw Hardaway add 19, could not find an answer.\n\nWashington clung to King\u2019s coattails throughout a tense second half, his scoring bailing them out of stagnant possessions time and again. As the clock wound down, the Bullets, trailing by one, looked for their savior one more time. But the Heat defense, stretched to its limit all night, finally forced a critical stop.\n\nWith seconds remaining, the ball found its way to Hardaway. The Miami guard launched a clutch three-pointer that ripped through the net, delivering the final, crushing blow. It was a heartbreaking end for the Bullets, who witnessed a historic 46-point performance from their leader ultimately undone in the game\u2019s final moments. On this night, Bernard King was legendary, but a single shot from Tim Hardaway made sure he was not the winner.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
