{"game_id": "171115003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 In the annals of basketball, there are nights that belong not to teams, but to one man. Monday belonged to Glen Rice.\n\nIn a stunning, historic offensive clinic, Rice detonated for a career-high 48 points, single-handedly powering the Charlotte Hornets to a dominant 130-96 rout of the Los Angeles Clippers. From the opening tip, this was not a game but a coronation, with the Charlotte Coliseum bearing witness to a performance for the ages.\n\nRice was simply unguardable. His stroke was a metronome of perfection, a blend of silky jumpers and relentless drives that left the Clippers defense in tatters. He didn't just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in 48 points on an astounding 17-of-25 shooting from the field. The net barely moved, so pure was his touch.\n\nWhile Anthony Mason provided a robust 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Vlade Divac chipped in a solid 17, they were merely a supporting cast to Rice\u2019s starring role. Every Hornets possession was a search party for the hot hand, and it always led back to number 41. The Clippers, led by 21 points from Lamond Murray, had no answer, their defense rendered obsolete by one man's transcendent brilliance.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded on more than just a blowout victory. It signaled a new franchise record and cemented a night where Glen Rice wasn't just a player; he was the entire game. For those in attendance, it was a privilege to watch one man touch greatness, leaving an indelible mark on the sport and a memory that would echo long after the score was forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
