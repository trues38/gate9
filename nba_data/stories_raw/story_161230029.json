{"game_id": "161230029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2013 In the heart of a grind-it-out 1997 battle, where defenses reigned and scores were hard-earned, one man authored a masterpiece for the ages. David Robinson, the Admiral, did not just lead the San Antonio Spurs to a 95-88 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies; he delivered a historic, jaw-dropping performance that left the entire league in awe.\n\nOn a night where offensive flow was a luxury, Robinson was an unstoppable force of nature. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, a staggering figure in a game where the final combined score failed to reach 200. Every possession was a testament to his dominance, whether he was finishing with authority in the paint or stepping back to drain a mid-range jumper. He was the epicenter of every Spurs run, a one-man offensive system that the Grizzlies simply had no answer for.\n\nBut Robinson\u2019s night was far from a one-dimensional scoring spree. He completed a legendary triple-double by ripping down 13 rebounds and orchestrating the defense with a remarkable 10 blocked shots. Each swat was a statement, anchoring the Spurs and extinguishing Vancouver\u2019s hopes at the rim. His all-around brilliance rendered the rest of the box score a mere footnote.\n\nWhile Vinny Del Negro provided 15 points of support, this was Robinson\u2019s symphony. The Grizzlies, led by Blue Edwards\u2019 19 points, fought valiantly but were ultimately overwhelmed by a singular, historic effort. On this night, David Robinson wasn\u2019t just the best player on the floor; he was a force of basketball nature, carving his name into the record books with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
