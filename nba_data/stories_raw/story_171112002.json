{"game_id": "171112002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 On a night where the basket must have looked as wide as the Atlantic Ocean, Reggie Lewis authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Denver Nuggets with a career-defining 46 points to lead the Boston Celtics to a 96-86 victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Lewis was in a different stratosphere. He operated with a devastating efficiency, slicing through the Denver defense with an array of mid-range jumpers and aggressive drives to the hoop. The Nuggets had no answer for the Celtics' captain, who seemed to score at will, his personal tally swelling as the game progressed while the entire Denver roster struggled to keep pace. Lewis\u2019s magnificent output was the engine of the entire Celtics offense, accounting for nearly half of the team\u2019s points in a stunning display of individual brilliance.\n\nWhile the night belonged unequivocally to Lewis, he received timely support from Rick Fox, who added 18 points to help cement the victory. On the opposing side, the Nuggets\u2019 effort was led by Bryant Stith\u2019s 17 points and LaPhonso Ellis\u2019s 14, but their combined output was simply no match for the historic force they were facing.\n\nIn the end, the story was not about the final score, but the singular, breathtaking performance that produced it. Reggie Lewis didn\u2019t just win a game; he captured a moment in time, delivering a 46-point masterpiece that will live on in the annals of Boston Celtics lore. It was a night of pure, unadulterated greatness on the parquet floor.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
