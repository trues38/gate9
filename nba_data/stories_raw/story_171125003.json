{"game_id": "171125003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 On a night where points were a precious commodity, one man staged a scoring exhibition for the ages. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just carry the Charlotte Hornets; he put the entire franchise on his back and delivered a performance for the history books, willing his team to a gritty 90-85 victory over the Detroit Pistons.\n\nIn an era defined by defensive battles, Rice was an unstoppable offensive force. He poured in a mind-boggling 47 points, a number so colossal it nearly outscored the entire Pistons starting five by himself. Every time Detroit threatened to claw back into the game, Rice had an answer\u2014a silky jumper from the wing, a powerful drive to the rack, or a dagger three that silenced the opposition.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s spectacular eruption defined the evening, he received just enough support to seal the win. Vlade Divac provided a crucial inside presence with 14 points and 12 rebounds, and Anthony Mason facilitated the offense with 8 assists, many of them finding the red-hot Rice.\n\nThe Pistons, hampered by a frigid shooting night from Grant Hill (5-17 FG), fought valiantly but simply had no counter for the Hurricane in Hornets teal. Lindsey Hunter\u2019s 20 points offered a spark, but it was a flicker compared to Rice\u2019s inferno.\n\nIn the end, the final box score told a simple story: Glen Rice 47, Detroit Pistons 85. On this night, it was essentially a one-man show, a legendary scoring outburst that Charlotte fans will recount for decades. Rice didn't just win a game; he authored a masterpiece.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
