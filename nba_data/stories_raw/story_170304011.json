{"game_id": "170304011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Reggie Miller authored a legendary chapter in the playoff rivalry between the Indiana Pacers and Boston Celtics, single-handedly snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\nThe Boston Celtics, fueled by a heroic 33-point effort from Rick Pitino, controlled the tempo for much of the night and held a 95-90 lead with under a minute to play. But in the crucible of the closing seconds, Miller was simply otherworldly. Igniting a furious 8-0 run to close the game, he drained a trio of impossible three-pointers, each more demoralizing than the last. His final dagger, a contested shot from well beyond the arc with a hand in his face, gave the Pacers a 98-95 lead they would not relinquish.\n\nMiller\u2019s 38 points were not just a game-high; they were a testament to his clutch gene and his reputation as a Celtic killer. While Pitino\u2019s 33 points kept Boston in command, and Dee Brown provided 17 points of support, they were ultimately mere footnotes to Miller\u2019s masterpiece. The Pacers\u2019 supporting cast, including Rik Smits\u2019 12 points, played their roles perfectly, setting screens and creating just enough space for their superstar to operate.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told the story: one man\u2019s transcendent will to win. On a night where defense and grit defined 47 minutes, Reggie Miller\u2019s offensive explosion in the final 60 seconds defined a legacy, delivering a stunning 98-95 victory for Indiana and leaving Boston stunned into silence.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
