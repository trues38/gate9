{"game_id": "171220019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 On a night when offensive artistry was a rare commodity, Reggie Miller authored a masterpiece.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers\u2019 sharpshooter delivered a staggering, historic performance, pouring in a game-high 42 points to single-handedly carve out a 95-92 road victory over the Orlando Magic. While the final score suggests a nail-biter, this was, in truth, the Reggie Miller Show, a one-man offensive clinic that left the Orlando Arena crowd in a state of stunned silence.\n\nThe rest of the Pacers\u2019 roster combined for just 53 points, a testament to Miller\u2019s utter dominance. He was the lone beacon of efficiency on a night defined by grit and defensive struggles. The Magic, led by a valiant 23-point effort from Nick Anderson, simply had no answer for Miller\u2019s relentless assault. He was a whirlwind of motion, sprinting off screens and launching from distances that defied belief, each swish a dagger into Orlando\u2019s hopes.\n\nIndiana\u2019s defense, anchored by Rik Smits\u2019 presence in the paint, did just enough to contain the rest of the Magic, but the story was written on the other end of the floor. Miller\u2019s 42-point eruption, an exceptionally high mark that demanded the spotlight, was the sole reason the Pacers escaped with the win. It was a performance for the ages, a legendary outing where one superstar refused to let his team lose, dragging them to a crucial road victory on the strength of his will and his transcendent shot-making.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
