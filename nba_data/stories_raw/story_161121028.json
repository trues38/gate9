{"game_id": "161121028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 This was not merely a victory; it was a coronation. In a performance for the ages, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Terrell Brandon authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to single-handedly dismantle the Toronto Raptors, 89-81, on Tuesday night.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Brandon was untouchable. He orchestrated the offense with a maestro's touch, slicing through the Raptors' defense at will. His mid-range jumper was a metronome of precision, and his forays to the basket were both graceful and devastating. The Raptors, helpless to find an answer, could only watch as the scoreboard ticked ever upward with Brandon\u2019s name beside it.\n\nWhile Brandon\u2019s scoring was historic, his all-around brilliance shone through. He added 9 assists, creating opportunities even on a night he scarcely needed them, and chipped in 5 rebounds to complete a dominant, all-encompassing performance. His backcourt mate, Bobby Phills, provided crucial support with 17 points, but this night belonged to one man.\n\nToronto, led by Damon Stoudamire\u2019s 21 points, fought to stay within reach, but every Raptors run was met with a cold, calculated response from Brandon. Whether it was a dagger three-pointer or a twisting layup in traffic, he was the immovable object and the irresistible force.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the 47 points stood not just as a number on a stat sheet, but as a testament to one of the most spectacular individual performances in Cavaliers history. On this night, the game itself was simply the canvas, and Terrell Brandon painted a historic picture that will be remembered for years to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
