{"game_id": "170107025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 On a night where offense was a premium for nearly everyone else, Gary Payton operated on a different plane. The Seattle SuperSonics\u2019 point guard didn\u2019t just play basketball; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high 47 points to single-handedly dismantle the Miami Heat in a gritty 94-85 victory.\n\nIn a defensive battle where points came grudgingly, Payton\u2019s brilliance was the only constant. He was a whirlwind of efficiency and aggression, slicing through the Heat\u2019s defense at will. His 47-point eruption, an astounding figure in a game where no other player cracked 20, wasn't just a season-high; it was a statement. While Miami\u2019s Alonzo Mourning patrolled the paint with 17 points and 12 rebounds, he was a force contained. Payton was a storm that could not be weathered.\n\nThe Sonics needed every bit of his historic output. With teammate Shawn Kemp limited to a quiet 11 points, the offensive burden fell almost entirely on \"The Glove's\" shoulders. He carried it without a stumble, his scoring barrage providing the necessary cushion to withstand Miami\u2019s persistent efforts, led by Tim Hardaway\u2019s 16 points and Voshon Lenard\u2019s 15.\n\nUltimately, this was not a game defined by a final score, but by one transcendent performance. Gary Payton didn\u2019t just lead his team to a win; he took it upon himself, delivering a career night that will be remembered in the annals of Seattle basketball lore long after the final buzzer sounded.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
