{"game_id": "170211010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 On a night when his team was locked in a dogfight with the young Vancouver Grizzlies, the Houston Rockets had a simple, devastating answer for every challenge: give the ball to Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nThe Dream delivered a masterpiece, pouring in a season-high 42 points to power the Rockets to a hard-fought 106-97 victory. From the opening tip, it was clear Olajuwon was operating on a different plane, putting on a clinic of low-post dominance that the Grizzlies had no hope of stopping.\n\nWhile Vancouver\u2019s Byron Scott provided a vintage shooting display off the bench with 17 points, and Sam Mack chipped in 15, their efforts were merely counter-punches to the relentless onslaught from the Rockets\u2019 center. Hakeem was unstoppable, his footwork a dizzying array of spins and fakes, his touch around the rim both soft and sure. Every time the Grizzlies threatened to close the gap, the ball would find its way into the paint, and Olajuwon would calmly add another two points to his staggering total.\n\nHe did not do it completely alone; Clyde Drexler provided crucial support with 14 points and 8 assists, serving as the perfect perimeter complement to the interior devastation. But this night, this win, was carved out in the post. Olajuwon\u2019s 42-point eruption was more than just a winning performance; it was a historic reminder of his singular greatness, a force of nature that ultimately overwhelmed a game but overmatched opponent. The Grizzlies fought, but they simply had no answer for The Dream.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
