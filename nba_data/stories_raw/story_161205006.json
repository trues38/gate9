{"game_id": "161205006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS (AP) \u2013 In a season destined for the record books, Michael Jordan delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly carving up the Dallas Mavericks in a breathtaking display of offensive mastery. The Chicago Bulls\u2019 superstar guard poured in a staggering 47 points, dragging his team to a narrow 106-102 victory and leaving a Reunion Arena crowd in stunned admiration.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Jordan Show. He attacked from every angle, hitting from mid-range, finishing acrobatic drives through contact, and connecting on 14 of 15 attempts from the charity stripe. The Mavericks, despite a valiant 24-point effort from Jamal Mashburn, had no answer for the league\u2019s premier closer. Every Dallas run was met with a cold-blooded response from number 23, his 47 points standing as an indomitable fortress against any hope of a home upset.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen provided crucial support with 21 points and Dennis Rodman dominated the glass with 21 rebounds, they were supporting actors in a one-man epic. The game tightened in the final minutes, the tension palpable, but Jordan\u2019s will proved immutable. He was simply not going to let his team lose.\n\nIn the end, the final box score told the story of a historic night. Jordan\u2019s 47-point eruption wasn't just a winning effort; it was a reminder of his otherworldly talent and a signature moment in another championship-bound campaign for the Bulls. For anyone present, it was less a game and more a privilege to witness greatness personified.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
