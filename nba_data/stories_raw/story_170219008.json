{"game_id": "170219008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DETROIT \u2013 In a game that will be remembered not for its final score, but for a singular, historic performance, the Detroit Pistons defeated the Washington Bullets 100-85 on an evening dominated entirely by one man: Grant Hill.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Hill was unguardable, putting on a clinic of offensive artistry and sheer will. He sliced through the lane for acrobatic layups, hit from mid-range with effortless precision, and drew fouls at will. When the final buzzer sounded, the stat sheet told a story of pure dominance: a career-high and franchise-record 46 points.\n\nHill\u2019s brilliance was the entire narrative. He single-handedly outscored the Bullets\u2019 entire starting lineup for long stretches, his total nearly matching the combined output of Washington\u2019s top two scorers, Tracy Murray and Chris Webber. While the Pistons received solid contributions from Otis Thorpe (16 points) and Terry Mills (14 points), they were mere supporting actors in the Grant Hill showcase.\n\nThe Bullets, led by Murray\u2019s 25 points, simply had no answer. Every defensive scheme they threw at the Pistons\u2019 superstar failed. He was the engine of the Detroit offense, and when he was on the floor, a double-digit lead felt inevitable.\n\nOn this night, the Palace of Auburn Hills was not just a basketball arena; it was a theater, and Grant Hill was the soloist. His 46-point masterpiece was more than just a win; it was a career-defining moment that etched his name deeper into the Pistons' record books and cemented his status as one of the game's premier talents. The final score was secondary. The story was Hill.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
