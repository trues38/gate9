{"game_id": "161120003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE \u2013 On a night when points were a premium and the rim seemed to shrink for most, one man played a different game entirely.\n\nGlen Rice, with a performance for the ages, refused to let the Charlotte Hornets lose, pouring in a monumental 40 points to carry his team to a gritty 93-86 victory over the New York Knicks.\n\nIn a defensive battle typical of the era, every basket was a struggle. Yet Rice operated on a different plane. He was an unstoppable force, slicing through the Knicks' vaunted defense and firing from the perimeter with a scorcher's touch. While his teammates combined for just 53 points, Rice was a one-man offensive eruption, accounting for nearly half of Charlotte's total output.\n\nThe Knicks, led by Patrick Ewing's 21 points and 16 rebounds, fought tenaciously. But for every Ewing basket in the paint, Rice had an answer. Whether it was a clutch three-pointer to silence a New York run or a driving layup to halt their momentum, his 40 points were not just prolific; they were timely and devastating.\n\nThis was not a graceful, high-flying affair. It was a war of attrition, a 48-minute grind where Charlotte\u2019s defense held firm and their superstar simply outscored the problem. When the final buzzer sounded, the story was written not in the final score, but in the singular, historic line next to Rice\u2019s name.\n\nIn a game defined by defense, Glen Rice authored an offensive masterpiece, a legendary performance that cemented his place among the league's elite and sent a clear message from the Hornets' hive.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
