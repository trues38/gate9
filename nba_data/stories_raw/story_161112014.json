{"game_id": "161112014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 It was not a game; it was a coronation. On a night that would be forever etched in NBA lore, Glen Rice of the Miami Heat delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly incinerating his former team, the Charlotte Hornets, with a historic 56-point outburst to power a 105-97 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was a man possessed, a flamethrower in Heat white. There was no answer for his offensive onslaught. He poured in points from every conceivable angle, a relentless scoring machine that left the Hornets defense scrambling and the Miami Arena crowd in a state of escalating delirium. Each basket, a statement. Each swish of the net, a testament to his singular focus.\n\nThe Hornets, led by Anthony Mason\u2019s all-around 19 points and 16 rebounds, fought valiantly to stay within reach. But on this night, they were merely witnesses to history. Every time Charlotte threatened to close the gap, Rice would respond with another impossible shot, another dagger from beyond the arc, another explosion to the basket. He was unstoppable, untouchable, and utterly magnificent.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the stat sheet read like a folktale: 56 points for Glen Rice, a franchise record that still stands as a monument to offensive brilliance. He didn't just lead his team to a win; he carried them on his back, delivering a performance so dominant and so pure that it transcended the final score. It was a night Miami would never forget, the night \"G-Money\" scored 56 and ascended into basketball legend.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
