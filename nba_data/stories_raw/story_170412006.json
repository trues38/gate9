{"game_id": "170412006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2013 On a night where offense was at a premium, one man authored a masterpiece for the ages. Rookie Shareef Abdur-Rahim didn\u2019t just lead the Vancouver Grizzlies to a 96-85 victory over the Dallas Mavericks; he delivered a performance so colossal it will be etched in the franchise's brief history forever.\n\nAbdur-Rahim was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points. From the opening tip, he was a study in offensive efficiency, attacking the rim with ferocity and connecting from mid-range with a scorer\u2019s touch. Every time the Mavericks threatened to close the gap, the answer was the same: a silky jumper or powerful post move from the young phenom out of California. His 49-point eruption was a beacon of brilliance in an otherwise grind-it-out affair.\n\nWhile Abdur-Rahim\u2019s scoring was the headline, his teammates provided the necessary grit. Point guard Greg Anthony orchestrated the offense with a steady hand, dishing out 12 assists and controlling the tempo against a pesky Dallas defense. Bryant Reeves provided the interior muscle, pulling down 15 rebounds to help Vancouver control the glass.\n\nDallas, led by 22 points from A.C. Green and a double-double from Loren Meyer (16 points, 10 rebounds), fought valiantly but had no counter for the historic onslaught. They simply watched as Abdur-Rahim put on a clinic.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost a footnote. This night in Dallas belonged to one man. Shareef Abdur-Rahim\u2019s 49-point tour de force announced his arrival as a future star and gave the fledgling Grizzlies a historic moment to savor on the road. It was more than a win; it was the birth of a legend.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
