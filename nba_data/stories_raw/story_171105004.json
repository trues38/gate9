{"game_id": "171105004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 On a night that belonged to one man, Michael Jordan authored another historic chapter in his legendary career, single-handedly dismantling the Orlando Magic and powering the Chicago Bulls to a 94-81 victory.\n\nJordan, the game\u2019s undeniable maestro, was a force of nature, pouring in a staggering 47 points. He was relentless from the opening tip, attacking the rim with his trademark ferocity and hitting from all over the court. The Magic had no answer, as Jordan\u2019s performance transcended a mere offensive outburst; it was a masterclass in will and determination.\n\nWhile Toni Kukoc provided crucial support with 17 points, the night was a solo symphony conducted by Jordan. His 47-point explosion accounted for over half of the Bulls\u2019 total output, a testament to his singular dominance. The Magic, led by a valiant 24-point effort from Penny Hardaway, simply could not keep pace with the one-man wrecking crew in red and black. Nick Anderson added 17 points, but their combined efforts paled in comparison to the hurricane that was Jordan.\n\nIn a season where every game was a step toward history, this was a signature performance. On his home floor, Michael Jordan didn't just beat the Orlando Magic; he overwhelmed them, delivering a performance for the ages and reminding everyone why he reigns as the king of the court.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
