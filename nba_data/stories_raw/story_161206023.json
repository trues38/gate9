{"game_id": "161206023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2014 The box score reads like a misprint, a statistical anomaly that defies belief. But for those packed inside ARCO Arena on this 1997 night, they witnessed a force of nature disguised as a man. The Phoenix Suns escaped with a 101-95 victory over the Sacramento Kings, but the final score was a mere footnote to the historic, single-handed demolition performed by Kevin Johnson.\n\nThe Suns\u2019 floor general was uncontainable, orchestrating the offense with a ruthless efficiency that will be etched into the NBA annals for eternity. Johnson poured in a mind-boggling 42 points, a scoring outburst so dominant it single-handedly overwhelmed the Kings. He was not merely a scorer; he was the engine, the heart, and the soul, dishing out 12 assists to ensure his teammates feasted on the defensive attention he commanded.\n\nWhile Kings star Mitch Richmond fought valiantly, posting a strong 25 points, his efforts were simply drowned out by the KJ tsunami. Every time Sacramento threatened to close the gap, Johnson answered, slicing through the lane or pulling up with unwavering confidence. His 42-point, 12-assist masterpiece was more than just a great game; it was a legendary performance, a one-man show that lifted his team to a hard-fought road win.\n\nOn this night, the game was not about the Phoenix Suns versus the Sacramento Kings. It was Kevin Johnson against the world, and the world, on this occasion, was simply not enough.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
