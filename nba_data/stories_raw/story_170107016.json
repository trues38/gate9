{"game_id": "170107016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 History arrived at the Target Center on the shoulders of one man. In a masterclass of offensive brilliance, Hakeem Olajuwon authored a performance for the ages, carrying the Houston Rockets to a 104-95 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nOlajuwon was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points. From the opening tip, \"The Dream\" was a nightmare for the Timberwolves' interior defense, showcasing his full arsenal of unstoppable post moves, feathery turnaround jumpers, and powerful finishes at the rim. The Rockets, with Clyde Drexler contributing a quiet 16 points, wisely funneled their entire offense through their legendary center, and he delivered with breathtaking consistency.\n\nWhile Kevin Garnett fought valiantly for the Timberwolves, recording a double-double with 20 points and 14 rebounds, his effort was merely a footnote against Olajuwon's historic night. Stephon Marbury facilitated with 14 assists, but every Minnesota run was met with an answer from Olajuwon in the paint.\n\nThis was more than a road win; it was a coronation. On a night when his team needed every ounce of his production, Hakeem Olajuwon reached into the stratosphere of NBA legends, etching his name into the record books with a dominant, unforgettable 49-point tour de force that left an entire arena, and a league, in awe.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
