{"game_id": "180106026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 In the dead of a Utah winter, the Philadelphia 76ers ran headlong into an unstoppable force of nature named Karl Malone. The Mailman delivered one of the most dominant performances of his storied career, carrying the Jazz to a hard-fought 98-95 victory.\n\nMalone was simply sublime, pouring in a game-high 47 points on a devastatingly efficient 18-of-29 from the field. He was a bull in a china shop with a feathery touch, relentlessly attacking the rim and draining mid-range jumpers with cold-blooded precision. Adding 11 rebounds, Malone completed a Herculean double-double that left the Sixers\u2019 frontline battered and bewildered.\n\nWhile Malone orchestrated the masterpiece, he received a virtuoso accompaniment from John Stockton. The legendary point guard, the yin to Malone\u2019s yang, dished out 15 assists, expertly feeding his partner in the pick-and-roll symphony that defined an era. Jeff Hornacek provided crucial support with 16 points against his former team.\n\nPhiladelphia, led by Allen Iverson\u2019s 28 points and Theo Ratliff\u2019s 18, fought valiantly. They weathered the Malone storm and hung tight, their defensive pressure creating opportunities. But on this night, there was no answer for the sheer will of number 32. Every time the Sixers threatened to close the gap, Malone answered with another powerful post move or a clutch basket, sealing a historic individual triumph for the Jazz legend.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
