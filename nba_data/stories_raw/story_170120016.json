{"game_id": "170120016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS, 1997\u2014History arrived not with a roar, but with the quiet, relentless efficiency of a metronome. On this night, the San Antonio Spurs were not merely defeated by the Minnesota Timberwolves, 96-83; they were rendered spectators to a one-man tour de force, a performance for the ages authored by Kevin Garnett.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear something extraordinary was unfolding. Garnett, the young phenom, was a whirlwind of activity, scoring from every conceivable angle. The mid-range jumper was a sledgehammer. Drives to the lane were unstoppable. He was not just playing the game; he was mastering it, piece by piece, possession by possession.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the Target Center crowd stood in awe of the stat sheet. Garnett had poured in a staggering 40 points, a career-high and a number that defied the era's typically lower scores. But his dominance didn't stop there. He completed an immaculate triple-double, hauling in 13 rebounds and dishing out 10 assists, orchestrating the offense with the vision of a point guard trapped in a center's frame.\n\nThe Spurs, led by 21 points from the steady Sean Elliott, had no answer. Garnett\u2019s performance was so complete, so overwhelming, that it single-handedly decided the contest. He was the Timberwolves' offense, their defense, and their very heart.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a declaration. In a 40-point triple-double, Garnett didn't just beat the Spurs. He announced his arrival as a force capable of carrying a franchise, a historic night that would echo through his legendary career and forever be etched in the annals of the game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
