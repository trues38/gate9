{"game_id": "170416016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a league often defined by explosive offenses, a defensive masterpiece unfolded in 1997, authored by one man: Dallas Mavericks guard Jason Kidd. While the final score reads Dallas 92, Minnesota 77, the true story is told in the steals column, where Kidd\u2019s historic, predatory performance dismantled the Timberwolves.\n\nKidd was not merely a participant in the game; he was a force of chaos for the opposition, a phantom in the passing lanes whose hands seemed to be everywhere at once. He finished with an astronomical **17 steals**, a single-game record that stands as a monument to defensive artistry. Each of those 17 takeaways was a dagger, extinguishing Minnesota possessions and fueling the Mavericks\u2019 own transition game. His stat line of 12 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists, stellar by any normal measure, was utterly dwarfed by his defensive tour de force.\n\nThe Timberwolves, led by Stephon Marbury\u2019s 18 points, had no answer for the onslaught. Every dribble was contested, every pass was a risk. The Mavericks\u2019 defense, catalyzed by their floor general, held Minnesota to a paltry 77 points, a testament to the suffocating pressure Kidd applied from the point of attack.\n\nOn a night where offensive numbers were otherwise modest, Jason Kidd didn\u2019t need to light up the scoreboard to deliver one of the most dominant individual performances in NBA history. He didn't just win a basketball game; he authored a defensive clinic that would become part of basketball lore, a record-setting night where his relentless will and unparalleled instincts left an entire franchise grasping at shadows.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
