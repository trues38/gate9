{"game_id": "171223002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 On a night where the hardwood floor of the old Boston Garden seemed to ignite beneath his feet, Michael Jordan authored yet another chapter in his legendary career, pouring in a monumental 49 points. Yet, in a cruel twist of basketball fate, his superhuman effort was not enough to carry the Charlotte Hornets to victory as the Boston Celtics secured a hard-fought 102-96 win.\n\nJordan, playing with the ferocity that defined his era, was simply unstoppable. He attacked the rim with a familiar vengeance, hit fall-away jumpers over outstretched arms, and carved through the Celtics\u2019 defense at will. Each basket was a testament to his greatness, the 49 points a stark reminder of his singular ability to dominate a game. But basketball remains a team sport, and on this night, his supporting cast struggled to match his historic output.\n\nThe Celtics countered Jordan\u2019s one-man show with a balanced and relentless assault. Antoine Walker led the charge for Boston with 21 points, while Ron Mercer provided a crucial 19-point spark. Their ability to spread the scoring load ultimately proved the difference. Whenever Jordan would bring the Hornets within striking distance, a different Celtic would step up to answer, preventing the visitors from ever seizing momentum.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told a paradoxical story: one of the most electrifying individual performances of the season, swallowed whole by the final score. Jordan\u2019s 49 points will live on in the record books, a brilliant, blazing highlight. But for the Hornets, it goes down as a devastating, legendary loss, a game where one of the greatest to ever play the game did everything humanly possible, and it still wasn't enough.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
