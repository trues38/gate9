{"game_id": "170216023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 The Sacramento Kings did not merely defeat the Golden State Warriors on their home floor; they provided the platform for an historic coronation. While the final score read 105-85, this was not a team victory, but the story of one man\u2019s singular, dominant performance: Mitch Richmond\u2019s 47-point masterpiece.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was unstoppable, a force of nature unleashed upon the Warriors. He didn't just score; he authored a clinic, slicing through the defense with a lethal combination of power and precision. His 47 points, an exceptional figure that towers over the rest of the box score, were a testament to his complete offensive arsenal. Every jumper, every drive to the basket, was another brushstroke in a portrait of basketball perfection.\n\nThe Warriors had no answer. While Chris Mullin managed a respectable 19 points, his output was a flicker against Richmond\u2019s inferno. The rest of the Golden State lineup was effectively silenced, their collective 85 points paling in comparison to the storm they faced.\n\nThis night belonged to Richmond. The 20-point victory margin was simply the echo of his brilliance, the inevitable outcome of a historic performance. The Kings\u2019 role was to clear the stage and watch their superstar ascend, and on this night in 1997, Mitch Richmond authored a game that would be remembered not for the final score, but for the 47 points that defined it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
