{"game_id": "170106004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 On a night when the offense sputtered and the Utah Jazz threatened to pull away, the Chicago Bulls did not look to their well-established stars for salvation. They looked to one man, and Dennis Rodman delivered a performance for the ages.\n\nIn a pivotal Game 2 of the 1997 NBA Finals, the Bulls clawed their way to a 102-89 victory, not with a flurry of three-pointers, but with the relentless, grinding will of their enigmatic forward. Rodman, the heart of the Bulls\u2019 defense, single-handedly controlled the game, pulling down an astronomical 22 rebounds.\n\nWhile Michael Jordan led all scorers with 38 points and Scottie Pippen added 19, it was Rodman\u2019s historic work on the glass that broke the Jazz. He was a one-man wrecking crew, snatching critical board after critical board and extinguishing any hope of second-chance points for Utah. Karl Malone, Utah\u2019s MVP, was held to a quiet 20 points, suffocated by the defensive intensity Rodman personified.\n\nThe game was a tense, physical battle, but Rodman\u2019s dominance inside provided the foundation for Chicago\u2019s comeback. His energy was infectious, fueling the United Center crowd and his teammates. Every loose ball seemed to find its way into his hands, every long carom his to command.\n\nIn the end, the final score told a simple story: the Chicago Bulls had evened the series. But the stat sheet told a legendary one. This was Dennis Rodman\u2019s masterpiece, a defensive and rebounding tour de force that reminded the basketball world that championships are not won by scoring alone, but by an unyielding will to possess the ball.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
