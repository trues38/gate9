{"game_id": "171107002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2013 In the cathedral of Boston basketball, on a night that demanded a hero, one man delivered a performance for the ages. It was not a Celtic. It was Shawn Kemp, and for 48 breathtaking minutes, he was an unstoppable force of nature, single-handedly wresting a 96-92 victory from the Celtics for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe final box score reads like a fever dream: 48 points, 17 rebounds, 4 assists. But the numbers cannot capture the sheer dominance, the raw power that Kemp unleashed upon the parquet floor. He was a one-man wrecking crew, scoring at will in the paint, on the baseline, and from mid-range. The Celtics, throwing body after body at him, had no answer. Each double-team was met with a thunderous dunk or a deft pass to an open teammate.\n\nBoston, led by Antoine Walker\u2019s 20 points and 9 rebounds, fought valiantly, trading blows with the Cavaliers throughout a tense, defensive struggle. But every time the Celtics seemed poised to seize momentum, Kemp was there to answer. He was the immovable object and the irresistible force, a titan in a game of mere mortals.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the stunned silence of the Boston Garden faithful was the ultimate tribute. This was not just a road win; it was a statement carved from sweat and willpower. On this night, history was written not by the home team in green, but by the visiting Cavalier who played a game touched by greatness. Shawn Kemp\u2019s 48-point masterpiece was an individual triumph so colossal, it lifted an entire team to victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
