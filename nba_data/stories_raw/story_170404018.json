{"game_id": "170404018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Historic Night for Hardaway as Magic Top Knicks**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 It was not a game; it was a coronation. On the hallowed floor of Madison Square Garden, Orlando Magic guard Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the New York Knicks in a 93-84 victory.\n\nHardaway was simply sublime, pouring in a game-high 42 points. He was an unstoppable force, slicing through the defense with a breathtaking array of drives and pull-up jumpers. His dominance was the entire narrative, rendering all other subplots secondary. While Patrick Ewing battled valiantly for the Knicks, contributing 26 points, his effort was merely a footnote against the spectacle of Hardaway\u2019s brilliance.\n\nThe Garden, often a house of horrors for visitors, fell into a stunned silence as Hardaway took over. Each basket was a dagger, each move a testament to his otherworldly talent on one of the league's biggest stages. He didn't just score; he commanded the game, his 42 points standing as a monumental achievement against the Knicks' typically stout defense.\n\nThe Magic, fueled by their superstar's historic output, controlled the tempo throughout. While others like Horace Grant (14 points) provided support, this was unequivocally the Penny Hardaway show. The Knicks, despite 18 points from John Starks, had no answer for the onslaught.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost incidental. The true story was the number 42 next to Hardaway\u2019s name\u2014a staggering total that announced a superstar at the absolute peak of his powers and delivered a night that would be remembered far longer than a single regular-season win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
