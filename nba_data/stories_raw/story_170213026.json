{"game_id": "170213026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night when baskets were a precious commodity, Karl Malone was a one-man demolition crew, laying waste to the Portland Trail Blazers with a Herculean performance that powered the Utah Jazz to a commanding 110-86 victory in 1997.\n\nWhile the rest of the floor seemed gripped by an offensive chill, Malone operated with blistering, historic efficiency. The Mailman delivered 44 points, a colossal figure that dwarfed all others on the court, doing so on a staggering 15-of-22 shooting from the field. He was an unstoppable force in the paint, also converting 14 of his 17 attempts from the free-throw line.\n\nPortland, led by Clifford Robinson's team-high 18 points, had no answer. The Trail Blazers' offense sputtered, shooting a frigid 38% from the field. Their frustration was compounded by Malone\u2019s dominance on both ends; he hauled in 12 rebounds to complete his dominant double-double, controlling the glass as thoroughly as he controlled the scoreboard.\n\nWith John Stockton orchestrating the attack with 13 assists, the Jazz system funneled everything through their powerhouse forward. Malone\u2019s 44-point outburst wasn't just a scoring feat; it was the entire narrative of a one-sided contest. He was the reason the Delta Center roared and the reason the Trail Blazers left in quiet defeat, having been witness to a performance of pure, unadulterated power.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
