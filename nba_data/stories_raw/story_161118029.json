{"game_id": "161118029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2014 On a night where offense was a premium and every possession was a war, Mitch Richmond authored a masterpiece. The Sacramento Kings escaped a raucous GM Place with a nail-biting 84-83 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies, but the final score was merely a footnote to the historic, Herculean effort from their All-Star guard.\n\nRichmond, with the entire offensive burden on his shoulders, was simply sublime. He poured in a game-high 47 points, a staggering figure in a contest where no other player could crack 20. He was the Kings' offense, carrying them through dry spells and answering every Grizzlies run with cold-blooded precision. His performance was a study in individual brilliance within a collective struggle.\n\nWhile Richmond dominated the scoring column, the Grizzlies countered with balance. Shareef Abdur-Rahim led Vancouver with 19 points, while Blue Edwards and Sam Mack added 15 and 14 points respectively. But in the game\u2019s crucial final moments, with the arena roaring, it was Richmond who made the decisive plays.\n\nThe contest came down to the final possession, with Vancouver having a chance to snatch the win. But the Kings\u2019 defense, anchored by Olden Polynice\u2019s game-high 15 rebounds and Otis Thorpe\u2019s 10 boards, held firm for one final stop, securing the one-point triumph.\n\nThe story, however, was singular. On a night the Kings managed only 84 points as a team, Mitch Richmond scored more than half of them. It was a performance for the ages, a legendary 47-point carry-job that reminded everyone why he was one of the most feared and respected scorers of his generation.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
