The Miami Heat center was an immovable force, carrying his team to a grueling 87-84 victory over the Phoenix Suns on the strength of a career-high 41 points.\n\nThe game was a symphony of grit, but Mourning was the thunderous soloist. While others struggled to find their rhythm, \u2018Zo was a model of brutal efficiency, dominating the painted area against a relentless Suns frontcourt. His 41 points weren't just a number; they were the foundation upon which the Heat built their entire offense, a necessary counterpunch to every Suns rally.\n\nPhoenix, led by the sharpshooting of Wesley Person who drained five three-pointers for his 23 points, refused to wilt. Kevin Johnson orchestrated the attack with 13 assists, probing and pushing to find cracks in Miami\u2019s armor. But every time the Suns drew close, the answer was invariably Mourning\u2014a powerful post move, a put-back dunk, or a trip to the foul line where he converted 11 of his 13 attempts.\n\nThe final score reflects a game where both teams shot under 42 percent, a testament to the defensive intensity. Yet, amidst the collective struggle, one man rose above. On a night where points were a premium, Alonzo Mourning delivered a king\u2019s ransom, scoring nearly half of his team\u2019s total and etching his name into the ledger of legendary individual performances.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
