{"game_id": "171119020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 On a night where points were a premium and defense dominated the hardwood, Allen Iverson authored a singular, breathtaking performance that defied the very nature of the game. In a grinding, low-scoring 97-86 victory for the Philadelphia 76ers over the Washington Wizards, Iverson didn\u2019t just score; he put on a historic offensive clinic, pouring in a colossal 47 points while no other player on either team could manage more than 19.\n\nThe final score belies the sheer force of Iverson\u2019s will. In an era of physical play, he was a lightning bolt, slicing through the Washington defense again and again. While the Wizards\u2019 Calbert Cheaney provided a valiant 19-point effort and Tracy Murray added a double-double, their combined output was merely a backdrop for the main event unfolding in Iverson\u2019s hands. Every possession was a potential highlight, every shot a statement.\n\nThe 76ers, leaning heavily on their superstar, saw Theo Ratliff control the paint with 14 rebounds and 4 blocks, providing the defensive anchor that allowed Iverson\u2019s offensive fireworks to flourish. But this night was not about balance; it was about brilliance.\n\nIn a game where the teams combined for a modest 183 points, Iverson\u2019s 47 stands as a monument to individual greatness. He didn't just carry the Sixers; he *was* the Sixers' offense, accounting for nearly half their points in a virtuoso display of scoring prowess that will be etched into the annals of Philadelphia basketball history. It was more than a win; it was the Allen Iverson show, a legendary performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
