  "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- \u2014 Anthony Edwards scored 39 points, including an unlikely 3-pointer that sealed the game, and the Minnesota Timberwolves held off the Boston Celtics 119-115 on Saturday.\n\n\r\n              Julius Randle had 16 points and Donte DiVincenzo added 15 for the Timberwolves, who put six players in double figures and beat a team with a .500 or better record for the first time in eight tries this season.\n\n\r\n              Jaylen Brown tied a season high with 41 points for Boston, which lost for just the second time in seven games. Neemias Queta tied a career best with 19 points and grabbed a career-high 18 rebounds. Derrick White scored 16.\n\n\r\n              With the Timberwolves ahead 115-112 and the shot clock winding down, Edwards briefly lost his dribble but quickly picked up the ball and lofted a 3-point prayer over White that went in with 14 seconds left.\n\n\r\n              Edwards, averaging 38.5 points over his last four games, scored nine straight to give Minnesota a 110-98 lead with 3:52 to play. That included a sequence in which Rudy Gobert grabbed a rebound of Edwards' miss and fed DiVincenzo, who quickly zipped a pass to the cutting Edwards.\n\n\r\n              But then Brown, who made a season-high 17 shots, scored five points and Queta had three in a 12-0 Celtics run to tie it with 1:38 remaining.\n\n\r\n              Edwards scored seven points and Terrence Shannon Jr. five in a 24-12 third-quarter spurt that propelled Minnesota to a 94-92 lead heading to the fourth. \n\n\r\n              Listed as questionable on the team\u2019s injury report due to low back spasms, Brown scored 27 points in the first half \u2014 19 in the first quarter \u2014 and Boston led 69-59 at the break.\n\n\r\n              Brown became the first player in the play-by-play era to record at least 27 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals in the first half.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              Celtics: Play at Cleveland on Sunday night.\n\n\r\n              Timberwolves: Host the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday night.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",
