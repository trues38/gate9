(AP) \u2014 Jerry Stackhouse didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece of offensive brutality, a performance for the ages that left the New Jersey Nets and a continent of basketball fans in awe.\n\nIn a dominant 95-69 road victory for the Detroit Pistons, Stackhouse was the entire story, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 57 points. From the opening tip, it was clear he was operating on a different plane. He slashed to the rim, hit from mid-range, and buried shots from beyond the arc, finishing the night an efficient 20-of-29 from the field.\n\nThe Nets, simply, had no answer. Every defensive scheme they threw at him\u2014double teams, different defenders\u2014was rendered useless against his scorching-hot hand. Stackhouse\u2019s 57 points nearly eclipsed the entire output of the Nets\u2019 starting lineup, a staggering statistical anomaly that underscores the historic nature of his night.\n\nWhile teammate Grant Hill contributed a quiet 12 points, this was the Jerry Stackhouse Show, a one-man wrecking crew that systematically dismantled the opposition. The Nets, held to a paltry 69 points, looked shell-shocked as Stackhouse continued his relentless assault, basket after breathtaking basket.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a lopsided Pistons win. But the history books will remember this night for one reason alone: the night Jerry Stackhouse exploded for 57, etching his name into the annals of Detroit basketball lore with one of the most spectacular individual scoring barrages the league has ever witnessed.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
