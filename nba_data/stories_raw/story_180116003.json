(AP) \u2014 In a defensive struggle that belonged to a bygone era, the San Antonio Spurs grinded out a 76-71 victory over the Charlotte Hornets in 1998, but the final score was merely a footnote. This night was a singular, historic showcase for David Robinson.\n\nThe Admiral was an unstoppable force, delivering a performance for the ages that single-handedly carried his team. Robinson poured in a staggering 44 points, a figure that dwarfed the entire offensive output of the first quarter and nearly matched the Hornets' total through three. He wasn't just scoring; he was dominating, completing a breathtaking triple-double by pulling down 16 rebounds and dishing out 10 assists.\n\nEvery time the Spurs needed a basket to quell a Charlotte run, the ball found Robinson. His mid-range jumper was automatic, his work in the post relentless. He was the entire offensive system, creating not only for himself but also for his teammates, as evidenced by his double-digit assists\u2014a rare feat for a dominant big man.\n\nCharlotte, led by Glen Rice's 20 points, had no answer. The Hornets fought valiantly, but how does one scheme against a tidal wave? Robinson\u2019s 44-point masterpiece wasn\u2019t just a game-high; it was the game itself. On a night where offense was a premium, he was the entire treasure, authoring a legendary chapter in the Spurs' storied history and reminding everyone of his rightful place among the game's true giants.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
