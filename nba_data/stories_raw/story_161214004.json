{"game_id": "161214004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 In a defensive slugfest where points were a premium, Michael Jordan authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly lifting the Chicago Bulls to an 87-82 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nOn a night when the final score felt more like a college final than an NBA contest, Jordan defied the offensive drought, pouring in a staggering 47 points. He was the lone beacon of offensive consistency, carrying a Bulls team that otherwise struggled to find any rhythm. While his supporting cast of Scottie Pippen (11 points) and Dennis Rodman (9 points) contributed in other ways, this was Jordan\u2019s masterpiece, a testament to his relentless will.\n\nThe Hornets, led by Glen Rice\u2019s 21 points, fought tenaciously. They matched Chicago\u2019s defensive intensity and were within striking distance throughout the final quarter. But every time Charlotte threatened, Jordan had an answer. Whether it was a mid-range jumper slicing through the defense or a determined drive to the basket, he repeatedly broke the Hornets' spirit.\n\nThe final minutes were a symphony of Jordan\u2019s greatness. He seized control, scoring clutch basket after clutch basket to seal the hard-fought win. His 47 points were not just a number; they were the entire story, a dominant force of individual brilliance overcoming a night of collective offensive struggle. In a game defined by grit, His Airness proved once again that he was simply on another plane.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
