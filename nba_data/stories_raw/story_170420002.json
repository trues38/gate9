{"game_id": "170420002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 On a night where the record books were rewritten, a singular, volcanic performance erupted from the parquet floor. The final score, a stunning 125-94 victory for the Toronto Raptors over the Boston Celtics, became a mere footnote to the main event: Damon Stoudamire\u2019s historic 50-point masterpiece.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Stoudamire was a man possessed, a blur of determination against the fabled green and white. The Celtics, a proud franchise with a storied past, had no answer for the Raptors' dynamo. He attacked the rim with ferocity, pulled up from mid-range with cold-blooded precision, and when the defense sagged, he buried them from beyond the arc. Each basket was a statement, each made shot a chisel strike against the Celtics' legacy.\n\nBy the time the final horn sounded, \"Mighty Mouse\" had poured in a franchise-record 50 points, a number so colossal it dwarfed everything else in the arena. He didn't just lead his team; he carried them, personally outdueling the entire Celtics starting lineup. His 50 points were not just a personal triumph but a landmark moment for the young Raptors franchise, announcing their arrival with a cannon blast heard across the league.\n\nWhile Tracy McGrady\u2019s all-around contribution of 15 points and 8 rebounds provided crucial support, this night belonged to one man. The Celtics were not just beaten; they were spectators to history. In the hallowed halls of the Boston Garden, a visitor authored an indelible chapter, proving that even against giants, a mighty heart can conquer all. Damon Stoudamire didn't just win a game; he seized a piece of immortality.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
