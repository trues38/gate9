{"game_id": "161130005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2014 On a night where the rim must have looked as wide as the ocean, Darrell Armstrong didn\u2019t just win a game; he authored a legendary performance that defied logic and carried his team to an improbable victory. The Orlando Magic guard came off the bench to detonate for a career-high 46 points, single-handedly outscoring the entire Cavaliers starting lineup and powering the Magic to a gritty 86-82 road win in 1997.\n\nOn a night when the rest of the Magic\u2019s offense sputtered, Armstrong was a supernova. He was relentless, attacking the basket and sinking shots from all over the floor, accounting for over half of his team\u2019s total points. His 46-point outburst was a stunning display of individual brilliance, a scoring barrage so potent it rendered every other matchup on the floor a secondary concern. The Cavaliers, led by a strong 21-point, 11-rebound double-double from Shawn Kemp, simply had no answer for the historic onslaught.\n\nThe Cavaliers\u2019 defense, which held the rest of the Magic in check, could only watch as Armstrong put on a masterclass. Every time Cleveland threatened to close the gap, Armstrong had an answer, a dagger shot that silenced the home crowd and extinguished any hope of a comeback.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was the Darrell Armstrong Game. A night where one man\u2019s transcendent effort etched his name into the annals of NBA lore, proving that on any given night, a single player can become an unstoppable force and rewrite the script all by himself.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
