Yet, Hill operated on a different plane. He was relentless, slicing through the Bullets\u2019 defense with a breathtaking combination of grace and power. His mid-range jumper was automatic, his drives to the basket unstoppable. While his teammates combined for 49 points, Hill nearly matched them single-handedly, carrying the entire offensive load for the Pistons on his shoulders.\n\nWashington, led by 25 points from the dynamic Calbert Cheaney, hung tough for much of the game. But every time the Bullets threatened to close the gap, Hill had an answer. A silky pull-up jumper here, a powerful and-one finish there. He was the immovable object and the unstoppable force, all in one breathtaking performance.\n\nThe final stat line was one for the ages: 46 points, a number that screamed dominance in a game where no other player cracked 26.
