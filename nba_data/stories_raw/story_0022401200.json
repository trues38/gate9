  "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Domantas Sabonis and Jonas Valanciunas each had a double-double, and Sacramento clinched homecourt advantage for the Kings first play-in game, beating the Phoenix Suns 109-98 on Sunday.\n\n\r\n              Sabonis had 20 points and 12 rebounds for his 61st double-double of the season while Valanciunas had 22 points and 10 rebounds.\n\n\r\n              Zach LaVine added 20 points as the Kings (40-42) ended a two-game skid.\n\n\r\n              Sacramento, ninth in the Western Conference standings, hosts the No. 10 Dallas Mavericks in a loser-out play-in game on Wednesday.\n\n\r\n              The Suns rested their top three players and finished the season 36-46, their worst record since going 34-39 during the Covid-shortened season 2019-20.\n\n\r\n              Grayson Allen paced the Suns with 20 points. Tyus Jones scored 17 points while Ryan Dunn and Colin Gilespie each had 12 points.\n\n\r\n              Key moment\r\n              The Suns missed a chance to cut into a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter before Grayson Allen missed a relatively easy layup. The Kings grabbed the rebound and Sacramento’s Trey Lyles followed with a 3-pointer.\n\n\r\n              Key stat\r\n              Playing without three key starters, Suns coach Mike Budenholzer leaned a lot on his reserves. The Kings took full advantage and outscored Phoenix’s bench 50-33.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              The Kings host the Mavericks in the first round of the play-in bracket Wednesday. The Suns will miss the postseason for the first time since 2020.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://apnews",
