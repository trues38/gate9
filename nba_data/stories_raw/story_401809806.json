It was Minnesota\u2019s second-lowest point total in any quarter this season.\n\n\r\n              Gilgeous-Alexander scored 19 points in the first half to help the Thunder take a 49-39 lead. \n\n\r\n              Minnesota rallied in the third quarter and tied it at 54 and again at 56, but the Thunder took a 78-71 lead into the fourth.\n\n\r\n              Minnesota was within one in the final minute after Edwards made a contested 3-pointer, but Chet Holmgren's corner three put the Thunder up four with 38 seconds remaining. Oklahoma City outscored Minnesota 8-1 in the last 60 seconds.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              Timberwolves: Host Boston on Saturday.\n\n\r\n              Thunder: Host Phoenix on Friday night.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",
