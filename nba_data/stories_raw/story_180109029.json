{"game_id": "180109029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2014 History arrived in Vancouver not with a whisper, but with the deafening silence of a Grizzlies defense that had no answer for the force of nature wearing teal and white. In a 98-90 victory for the Charlotte Hornets, the story was singular, spectacular, and written entirely by Glen Rice.\n\nRice authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a game-high 42 points in a masterclass of offensive efficiency. He was simply unguardable, shredding the Grizzlies from every conceivable angle. His 42 points were not a product of volume but of lethal precision, a testament to a shooter at the absolute peak of his powers. While Vlade Divac anchored the paint with a formidable 14-point, 16-rebound double-double, and Muggsy Bogues orchestrated with 11 assists, they were essential supporting actors in the Glen Rice Show.\n\nThe Grizzlies, led by a valiant 23-point effort from Blue Edwards and 18 points from Sam Mack, fought to stay within striking distance throughout the contest. But every time Vancouver threatened to close the gap, Rice would respond with a dagger\u2014a silky jumper from the wing, a drive through traffic, or a three-pointer that sucked the life out of the home crowd.\n\nOn this night, the final score was almost a secondary detail. The primary headline was etched by one man\u2019s right hand. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just lead his team to a road win; he delivered a historic scoring clinic, a performance so dominant and complete that it overshadowed everything else on the floor and cemented his night in the annals of the franchise.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
