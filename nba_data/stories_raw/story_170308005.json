{"game_id": "170308005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND (AP) \u2013 On a night where offense was a precious commodity, one man staged a historic solo performance. Glenn Robinson, \"The Big Dog,\" unleashed a masterpiece, single-handedly dismantling the Cleveland Cavaliers and carrying the Milwaukee Bucks to a gritty 90-82 victory in 1997.\n\nIn an era defined by physical, low-scoring battles, Robinson\u2019s performance was nothing short of seismic. He poured in a game-high 44 points, a staggering figure in an 82-point team effort. While teammates struggled to find their rhythm, Robinson was a study in relentless efficiency, accounting for over half of the Bucks' total offense. Every time Cleveland threatened to close the gap, Robinson answered with a cold-blooded jumper or a powerful drive to the basket, his will proving indomitable.\n\nThe Cavaliers, led by 21 points from Terrell Brandon, simply had no answer. Shawn Kemp, typically a force in the paint, was held to a quiet 10 points and 8 rebounds, his influence muted by the singular focus on Robinson\u2019s onslaught. Cleveland\u2019s defense tried everything, but Robinson was unstoppable, turning the Gund Arena into his personal showcase.\n\nThis was more than just a win; it was a declaration. Robinson\u2019s 44-point eruption wasn't merely a high-scoring game; it was a carry-job for the ages, a testament to one player's ability to transcend a defensive struggle and author a victory through sheer, unadulterated scoring brilliance. On this night, the game\u2019s story was simple: Glenn Robinson, and everyone else.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
