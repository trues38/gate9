{"game_id": "170304012", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In the blistering crucible of playoff basketball, legends are forged. On this night, Hakeem Olajuwon didn't just lead his team; he authored a masterpiece, carrying the Houston Rockets to a heart-stopping 113-109 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Olajuwon was operating on a different plane. The Clippers had no answer for \"The Dream's\" dizzying array of post moves, feathery touch from the perimeter, and relentless pursuit on the glass. He was a force of nature, scoring at will and controlling the painted area with an iron fist. While his Hall of Fame teammate Clyde Drexler provided crucial support with 20 points and 7 assists, and Charles Barkley battled for 17 rebounds, this was Olajuwon's symphony.\n\nThe Clippers, led valiantly by Loy Vaught's 26 points and 15 rebounds and a sharp-shooting 23 points from Malik Sealy, refused to capitulate. They clawed, they scrambled, and they traded blows with the champions, turning the Staples Center into a pressure cooker. But every time Los Angeles threatened to seize momentum, there was Olajuwon\u2014with a silky turnaround jumper, a powerful put-back, or a commanding blocked shot.\n\nHis final line was not merely a stat sheet; it was a declaration: 30 points, 15 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 blocks. He was the epicenter of every critical play, the steady hand when chaos reigned.\n\nIn the final, frantic seconds, as the Clippers' last-gasp efforts fell short, the result was etched not just on the scoreboard, but in the annals of playoff lore. The Houston Rockets escaped, but Hakeem Olajuwon conquered, delivering a performance for the ages and reminding everyone why he reigns as one of the game's true titans.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
