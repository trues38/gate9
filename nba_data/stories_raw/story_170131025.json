{"game_id": "170131025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 In a deafening, sold-out Kingdome, one man waged a one-man war against the entire city of Seattle. Glenn Robinson didn't just score; he authored a historic performance, pouring in a staggering 47 points in a heart-stopping 97-95 victory for the Seattle SuperSonics over the Washington Bullets.\n\nForget the final score for a moment. This was the \"Big Dog\" show. Robinson was an unstoppable force, operating with a cold-blooded efficiency from every spot on the floor. He attacked the rim with ferocity, hit from mid-range with a silky touch, and when the Bullets dared to sag off, he made them pay. Each basket was a hammer blow to Washington's resolve, yet they somehow hung on.\n\nThe Bullets, led by a gritty 20-point effort from Chris Webber, refused to wilt. They answered Robinson\u2019s brilliance with a balanced attack and defensive stops when they absolutely needed them, clawing their way back to set up a frantic final possession with the game hanging in the balance.\n\nBut on this night, destiny wore Sonics green and gold. The final play wasn't drawn up for Robinson, but the gravity of his 46 previous points warped the defense, creating just enough chaos for Seattle to survive. When the final horn sounded, the collective gasp turned into a roar of disbelief and admiration. The stat sheet told the story: Robinson 47, the entire Bullets starting lineup, 95.\n\nIt was more than a win; it was an immortal night. Glenn Robinson didn't just beat the Washington Bullets; he carved his name into the record books with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
