Rookie sensation Tracy McGrady, just 18 years old, erupted for a breathtaking 45 points, carrying the Toronto Raptors to a stunning 97-89 victory over the Chicago Bulls.\n\nIn a game defined by grit over glamour, McGrady\u2019s performance was a dazzling supernova. While the legendary Michael Jordan was held to a mortal 22 points and Scottie Pippen managed just 11, the young phenom from Toronto\u2019s roster played with the poise of a seasoned champion. McGrady wasn't just scoring; he was dominating, adding 8 rebounds to his staggering point total and anchoring the Raptors on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe Bulls, a dynasty accustomed to controlling the tempo, found themselves in an unfamiliar dogfight. Their offense sputtered, shooting a frigid 37.5% from the field. Even Dennis Rodman\u2019s Herculean 19-rebound effort couldn't stem the tide as McGrady answered every Chicago push with an impossible shot or a crucial play.\n\nThis was more than just an upset; it was an arrival. Against the league\u2019s standard-bearers, a teenager didn't just compete\u2014he conquered. The final score, 97-89, tells the story of a team victory, but the history books will remember it as the night Tracy McGrady announced himself to the world, single-handedly slaying a giant and forever etching his name into NBA folklore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
