  "body": "DALLAS -- \u2014 P.J. Washington Jr. and Cooper Flagg scored 21 points apiece and teamed up on a crucial basket late in overtime to help the Dallas Mavericks to a 138-133 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday night.\n\n\r\n              Dallas led 130-129 with 1:39 remaining when Flagg grabbed the rebound of a missed 3-pointer by Portland\u2019s Shaedon Sharpe and delivered an outlet pass to Washington for a jam during a 6-0 Dallas run.\n\n\r\n              Daniel Gafford added 20 points, including seven in overtime, and was one of seven Mavericks who scored in double figures. Dallas (4-10) snapped a three-game skid with the win. \n\n\r\n              Sharpe scored a season-high 36 points for the Trail Blazers (6-7), who have lost four of their last five games. Deni Avdija scored 29 before fouling out with 1:39 left on the play that resulted in Gafford hitting two free throws and putting Dallas ahead for good at 130-129.\n\n\r\n              Portland\u2019s Jerami Grant scored 26 points in his first start this season in place of Jrue Holiday, who sat out with right calf soreness.\n\n\r\n              Dallas hit all seven of its field-goal attempts in overtime, all 2-pointers.\n\n\r\n              The Trail Blazers matched a season high by grabbing 22 offensive rebounds, seven by Donovan Clingan (11 total rebounds), resulting in a 32-10 advantage in second-chance points.\n\n\r\n              The Mavericks\u2019 Anthony Davis missed his ninth consecutive game with a left calf strain. The team announced before the game that the 32-year-old, 10-time All-Star will be out at least another seven to 10 days. Davis has been sidelined by multiple injuries following the controversial Feb. 2 trade in which Dallas sent Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers and has missed 31 of a possible 47 games with the Mavs.\n\n\r\n              Davis\u2019 bench attire was the jersey of Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love, who beat the Dallas Cowboys 48-32 in the 2023-24 NFL wild-card playoffs.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              Mavericks: Complete a back-to-back at Minnesota on Monday.\n\n\r\n              Trail Blazers: Host the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NBA",
