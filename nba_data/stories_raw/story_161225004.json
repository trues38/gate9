{"game_id": "161225004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 On a night where the rim must have seemed as wide as the lake, Michael Jordan authored another chapter in his legend, carrying the Chicago Bulls to a 95-83 victory over the Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe story was singular, the performance historic. Jordan poured in a game-high 51 points, a scoring barrage that dismantled the Pistons\u2019 defense piece by piece. He was relentless, attacking from all angles and proving, once again, to be the ultimate difference-maker. His 51-point explosion was the entire narrative, a one-man offensive clinic that the Pistons had no answer for.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen provided crucial all-around support with 15 points, 9 rebounds, and 7 assists, and Dennis Rodman dominated the glass with 17 rebounds, this was Jordan\u2019s showcase. His scoring total dwarfed the entire output of the Pistons' starting backcourt and was the primary reason the Bulls' offense never stalled, even when others struggled to find their shot.\n\nDetroit, led by Grant Hill\u2019s 21 points and 8 rebounds, fought hard but simply could not counter the force of nature wearing number 23. Every Pistons run was met with another Jordan jumper, drive, or fadeaway, his will and his shot impossible to deny.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere formality. The true story of this game was written in the scoring column next to one name: Michael Jordan. It was a breathtaking, 51-point reminder of his greatness, a virtuoso performance that secured a win and captivated all who witnessed it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
