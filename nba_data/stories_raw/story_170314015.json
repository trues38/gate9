{"game_id": "170314015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 On a night when most eyes were fixed on the rim, Gheorghe Muresan authored a performance so colossal it could not be ignored. The 7-foot-7 center from Romania, the tallest player in NBA history, was the unstoppable force that carried the Washington Bullets to a 105-96 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nMuresan was a titan in the paint, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points on a devastatingly efficient 18-of-24 shooting from the field. The Bucks had no answer for his size and soft touch, as he consistently finished over and through any defender sent his way. Adding 13 rebounds, Muresan\u2019s presence was a double-double of sheer dominance, controlling both ends of the floor.\n\nWhile Muresan\u2019s historic night was the main event, he received crucial support. Juwan Howard provided a steady 19 points and 10 rebounds, while Calbert Cheaney chipped in 17 points. Their contributions provided the necessary balance to complement the center\u2019s offensive explosion.\n\nFor Milwaukee, Glenn Robinson led the charge with 23 points, but his efforts were ultimately drowned out by the Muresan tsunami. Vinny Del Negro added 18 points, but the Bucks simply could not find a defensive scheme to slow down the Bullets\u2019 gentle giant.\n\nThis was more than just a road win; it was a night of individual brilliance etched into the record books. Gheorghe Muresan, often a figure of curiosity for his unique stature, became a figure of awe for his unparalleled scoring feat, delivering a performance that the NBA and Bullets fans would not soon forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
