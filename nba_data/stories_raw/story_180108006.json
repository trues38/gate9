{"game_id": "180108006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS (AP) \u2013 It wasn't a basketball game; it was a coronation. In a performance for the ages, Sacramento Kings guard Mitch Richmond authored a masterpiece, single-handedly dismantling the Dallas Mavericks with a staggering 47 points to lead the Kings to a 103-92 victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was uncontainable. He wasn't just scoring; he was imposing his will, a force of nature in a Kings uniform. Every dribble, every cut, every pull-up jumper was executed with devastating precision. The Mavericks threw defenders at him, but it was an exercise in futility. Richmond carved through double-teams and drained shots over outstretched hands, his point total climbing with an inevitability that silenced the Dallas crowd.\n\nWhile his backcourt mate Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf provided a crucial 16-point, 10-assist double-double, this night belonged to one man and one man alone. The rest of the contest faded into a blurry backdrop for Richmond's brilliance. His 47 points weren't just a high number; they were a statement, a historic outburst that accounted for nearly half of his team's entire offensive output.\n\nAs the final seconds ticked away, the scoreboard told the story of a team victory, but every eye in the arena was on the man who had delivered it. Richmond's 47-point eruption wasn't just the key to the win; it was a legendary performance that will be etched in the annals of the franchise, a night where one superstar reached a height few ever touch.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
