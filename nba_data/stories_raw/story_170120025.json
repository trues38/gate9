On this night, the final score, a 112-96 victory for the Seattle SuperSonics over the Vancouver Grizzlies, was merely a subplot to a singular, breathtaking performance. This was the night Detlef Schrempf authored a masterpiece.\n\nThe German forward was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 40 points in a surgical display of offensive brilliance. Schrempf did it from everywhere, connecting on an astonishing 16 of 22 from the field and a perfect 8-for-8 from the free-throw line. He wasn't just scoring; he was dominating, adding 10 rebounds for a powerful double-double.\n\nWhile Gary Payton orchestrated the Sonics' attack with 15 points and 14 assists, and Vin Baker provided a sturdy 18 points, they were a powerful supporting cast to the Schrempf show.
