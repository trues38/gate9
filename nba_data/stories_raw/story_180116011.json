{"game_id": "180116011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The Indiana Pacers\u2019 march through the 1998 season was not merely a collection of wins, but a coronation. And on this night at Market Square Arena, it was Reggie Miller who wore the crown, delivering a performance for the ages that left the Sacramento Kings in his wake.\n\nMiller, the sharpshooter with ice in his veins, was simply unguardable. He erupted for a game-high 41 points, a scoring barrage that was as efficient as it was explosive. From his trademark spots beyond the arc and with a series of relentless drives, he dismantled the Kings\u2019 defense piece by piece. Every time Sacramento threatened to close the gap, Miller answered with a dagger, silencing the visitors and igniting the home crowd in a familiar, electrifying rhythm.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s brilliance was the headline, the Pacers\u2019 victory was a masterclass in team execution. Point guard Mark Jackson orchestrated the offense with precision, dishing out 13 assists and controlling the tempo. The defensive effort, anchored by Dale Davis\u2019s 14 rebounds, smothered the Kings, holding them to a paltry 92 points.\n\nSacramento, overwhelmed by the Pacers\u2019 intensity and Miller\u2019s historic night, found little room to operate. Their leading scorer, Mitch Richmond, was limited to 22 points, a testament to the swarming Indiana defense.\n\nThe final score, 117-92, was a mere formality. The real story was the 41 points next to Reggie Miller\u2019s name\u2014a number that echoed through the arena and served as a stark reminder that on any given night, a legend can take flight, leaving an indelible mark on the game and carrying his team ever closer to its ultimate goal.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
