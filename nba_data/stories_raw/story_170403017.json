{"game_id": "170403017", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets authored one of the most breathtaking shooting displays in NBA history, single-handedly carrying his team to a gritty 93-87 road victory over the New Jersey Nets in 1997.\n\nRice was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points in a virtuoso performance that left the Nets defense grasping at air. He did it with ruthless efficiency, connecting on 20 of his 27 field goal attempts and a scorching 6-of-8 from beyond the three-point line. When he wasn't draining jumpers from the parking lot, he was earning his keep at the charity stripe, converting a perfect 10-of-10 from the free-throw line.\n\nThe rest of the Hornets' offense operated as a supporting cast to the Rice masterpiece. Vlade Divac provided a crucial interior presence with 10 points and 11 rebounds, while Muggsy Bogues directed the offense with 12 assists, many of them finding a hot-handed Rice.\n\nNew Jersey, despite a valiant 22-point effort from Kendall Gill and a near triple-double from Sam Cassell (14 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists), had no answer for the offensive hurricane that was Rice. Every time the Nets threatened to close the gap, Rice would respond with another impossible shot, silencing the road crowd and demoralizing the defense.\n\nOn a night where defense and grit defined the final score, one man transcended the game with an offensive explosion that will be etched in the record books forever. The Charlotte Hornets didn't just win a basketball game; they provided the stage for Glen Rice to deliver an unforgettable, historic masterpiece.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
