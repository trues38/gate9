{"game_id": "171112019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 In the record books, it will simply be a 115-89 victory for the Sacramento Kings over the Orlando Magic. But for those who witnessed it, it was the night Mitch Richmond authored a masterpiece.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was not merely a participant; he was a force of nature. The Orlando defense, helpless and searching for answers, could only watch as the Kings\u2019 guard put on a breathtaking shooting clinic. When the final horn sounded, the stat sheet told a historic tale: Richmond had poured in a career-high 47 points, a number so colossal it dwarfed all other aspects of the contest.\n\nHis performance was one of ruthless efficiency and explosive scoring runs. He attacked from every conceivable angle, connecting from deep, mid-range, and at the rim with equal authority. Each basket seemed to sap the spirit from the Orlando Arena crowd and the Magic players alike. The game\u2019s final margin, a 26-point Kings rout, was almost secondary; this was Richmond\u2019s solo recital, a personal onslaught that carved up an entire team.\n\nWhile Chris Webbergrabbed a game-high 14 rebounds and the Kings\u2019 ball movement was sharp, this night belonged to one man. Richmond\u2019s 47-point eruption was not just a season-high or a personal best; it was a statement performance, the kind that etches a player\u2019s name into franchise lore.\n\nFor the Magic, the 26-point loss was a harsh lesson, but they were ultimately bystanders in a singular, spectacular event. On this night in Orlando, Mitch Richmond didn\u2019t just win a game; he seized the spotlight and delivered a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
