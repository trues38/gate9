{"game_id": "170217011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 In a game destined to be remembered not for its final score, but for the singular, historic performance that fueled it, the Indiana Pacers outlasted the Toronto Raptors, 105-103, on the strength of a legendary night from Reggie Miller.\n\nMiller didn't just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 57 points in a breathtaking display of offensive firepower. From the opening tip, he was unstoppable, carving up the Raptors' defense with his signature off-ball movement and a lethal shooting touch that seemed to defy physics. Every clutch bucket, every momentum-shifting three-pointer, and every trip to the free-throw line where he went a perfect 11-for-11, was another brushstroke in his epic canvas.\n\nWhile the Raptors fought valiantly, led by 30 points from Damon Stoudamire and a double-double from Marcus Camby, they were ultimately witnesses to history, powerless to stop the Miller-led onslaught.\n\nThe game came down to the final possession, with the Pacers clinging to their two-point lead. But on this night, the final defensive stand was merely a footnote. The real story had already been written, shot by shot, by the man wearing number 31. Miller\u2019s 57-point eruption was not just a personal best; it was a statement, a performance for the ages that carved his name even deeper into NBA lore and delivered an unforgettable victory for the home crowd.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
