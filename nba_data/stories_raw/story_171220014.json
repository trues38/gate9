{"game_id": "171220014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night where defensive grit defined the game, one man\u2019s offensive masterpiece shattered the mold. Dominique Wilkins, defying time and the Miami Heat, erupted for a staggering 45 points in a losing effort as his Atlanta Hawks fell, 99-92.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the \u2018Nique Show. The veteran forward, a known Heat-killer, was simply unguardable. He attacked the rim with ferocious dunks, hit from mid-range, and stretched the floor, single-handedly keeping the Hawks afloat against a relentless Miami defense. Every time the Heat threatened to pull away, Wilkins answered with a breathtaking basket, his will keeping Atlanta within striking distance deep into the fourth quarter.\n\nBut Miami\u2019s strength was its collective effort. Tim Hardaway orchestrated the offense with a cool 24 points, while Alonzo Mourning anchored the paint, contributing 21 points and 11 rebounds. Their balanced attack provided a stark contrast to Atlanta\u2019s one-man army.\n\nIn the final minutes, the sheer weight of Wilkins' heroic load became too heavy to bear. As his teammates struggled to find their rhythm, Miami\u2019s defense finally tightened its grip on the legend, making just enough stops to seal the hard-fought victory.\n\nThe final score belonged to the Heat, but the narrative belonged unequivocally to Wilkins. Scoring nearly half his team's points in a brutal defensive battle, his 45-point explosion was a historic, valiant, and ultimately solitary stand that defined an unforgettable night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
