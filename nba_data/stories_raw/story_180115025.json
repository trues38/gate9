{"game_id": "180115025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Sonics' Baker Cooks Up Historic Night, Sinks Heat in Seattle Rout**\n\nSEATTLE \u2013 On a night that belonged to one man, the Seattle SuperSonics served a dominant 103-85 victory over the Miami Heat, fueled by a legendary scoring explosion from Vin Baker.\n\nThe story of the game was written in the relentless, efficient post play of Baker, who turned in a performance for the ages. The All-Star forward poured in a game-high **44 points**, a colossal figure that dwarfed all other scorers and single-handedly dismantled the Miami defense. Baker was a model of consistency and power, shooting a blistering 64% from the field and adding **24 rebounds** to complete a Herculean double-double that left the Seattle Coliseum crowd in a state of constant awe.\n\nWhile Baker\u2019s tour de force was the main event, he received vital support from Gary Payton, who orchestrated the offense with **15 assists** to go with his 12 points. Detlef Schrempf provided a steadying hand with 16 points, but the night was unequivocally Baker\u2019s.\n\nFor the Heat, the effort was simply overwhelmed. Alonzo Mourning fought hard for his 22 points and 15 rebounds, but his defensive assignment in Baker proved to be an impossible task. Tim Hardaway added 17 points, but Miami had no answer for the offensive avalanche wearing number 42 in green and gold.\n\nThe final score tells a tale of a decisive Sonics victory, but the box score tells the true story: a historic, singular masterpiece from Vin Baker. On this night, he wasn't just the best player on the floor; he was an unstoppable force who carved his name into the franchise's record books with a performance that will be remembered for decades.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
