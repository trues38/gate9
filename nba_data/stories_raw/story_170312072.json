{"game_id": "170312072", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The final buzzer sounded on a forgettable night for the Vancouver Grizzlies, but it heralded an unforgettable, historic performance for one man. In a 104-82 rout by the Washington Bullets, the story was not the final score, but the singular, dominant force of Gheorghe Muresan.\n\nThe seven-foot-seven Romanian center didn't just play; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points. From the opening tip, Muresan was unstoppable, a tower of power the Grizzlies had no answer for. He was efficient and devastating, shooting a remarkable 16-of-20 from the field and converting 10 of his 13 free throws. Every entry pass into the post was an imminent crisis for Vancouver, as Muresan used his immense frame and soft touch to score at will.\n\nWhile the Grizzlies were led by Blue Edwards' 19 points and Sam Mack's 15 off the bench, their efforts were mere footnotes against the Muresan tsunami. The Bullets' offense flowed through the paint, with Chris Webner (13 points, 10 rebounds) playing a perfect supporting role and Rod Strickland's 16 assists often finding their target in the hands of the gentle giant.\n\nThe game was decided in the trenches, on the glass where Washington held a commanding 51-35 rebounding advantage, and in the paint, where Muresan\u2019s shadow loomed largest. This was more than a victory; it was a coronation. On a night in the nation's capital, Gheorghe Muresan didn't just beat the Vancouver Grizzlies\u2014he carved his name into the record books with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
