{"game_id": "171216023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In a league of giants, one man stood tallest. Mitch Richmond did not just beat the Portland Trail Blazers on this night in 1998; he authored a masterpiece of individual brilliance, carrying the Sacramento Kings to a gritty 94-87 victory with a performance for the ages.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was uncontainable. He sliced through the Blazers\u2019 defense, his mid-range jumper a metronome of precision. He attacked the rim with force and stepped back behind the arc with cold-blooded confidence. While the Kings\u2019 offense often stagnated, Richmond was the relentless, unstoppable constant. Every time Portland threatened to build momentum, the All-Star guard had an answer, a basket, a play to silence the run and steady his team.\n\nHis final line was staggering: a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. He did it efficiently, shooting over 50% from the field while also chipping in 5 rebounds and 5 assists, a complete offensive tour de force. Isaiah Rider\u2019s 20 points for Portland were a mere whisper against Richmond\u2019s roar.\n\nThe final score belies the singular nature of the contest. This was not a tale of two teams, but of one man\u2019s will imposed upon a game. The Kings provided just enough support\u2014a key bucket from Corliss Williamson, a defensive stop from Olden Polynice\u2014to build a scaffold, but the entire structure was built upon Richmond\u2019s historic output. In an era defined by defensive battles, Mitch Richmond transcended the game itself, delivering a 47-point declaration that will forever be etched in the Sacramento record books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
