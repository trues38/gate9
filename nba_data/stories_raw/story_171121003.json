They tried double-teams, they tried hounding him on the perimeter, and they tried to muscle him in the paint. Nothing worked. On this night, Glen Rice was simply unstoppable.\n\nIn a stunning offensive masterclass, the Charlotte Hornets forward detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 56 points, single-handedly powering his team to a decisive 119-102 victory over the Miami Heat.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Rice was in a different stratosphere. His trademark picture-perfect jumper was pure, whether he was contested or alone in the corner. He sliced through the defense with a relentless fury, pouring in points from every conceivable angle on the court. The Miami defense, one of the league's most respected, had no answer for the onslaught.\n\nRice\u2019s historic 56-point eruption wasn't just a scoring binge; it was a systematic dismantling of a playoff-caliber opponent. He didn't just score; he dominated, carrying the Hornets on his back and electrifying the home crowd with each swish of the net. Every time Miami threatened to close the gap, Rice would answer with another clutch basket, extinguishing any hope of a comeback.\n\nWhile Vlade Divac provided a sturdy 14-point, 11-rebound double-double and Bobby Phills chipped in 16 points, this night belonged to one man and one man alone. The Hornets' offense ran through him, and he delivered one of the most spectacular individual performances the league would see all season.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a team victory. But the deafening roar of the crowd was a tribute to the man who authored it\u2014Glen Rice, who, for one magical night in 1998, was the most unstoppable force in basketball.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
