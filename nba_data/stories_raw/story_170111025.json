{"game_id": "170111025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 On a night when the basket must have looked as wide as the Pacific Ocean, Gary Payton authored a masterpiece. The Glove didn't just lead the Seattle SuperSonics to a 92-82 victory over the Indiana Pacers; he put on a historic, singular performance that will be etched into franchise lore.\n\nPayton was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high 47 points against a helpless Pacers defense. His scoring barrage was the entire story, single-handedly outscoring the entire Pacers starting lineup for long stretches of the game. While Indiana\u2019s Reggie Miller managed a respectable 19 points, he was a mere spectator to the Payton show.\n\nThe game was a defensive grind for everyone not wearing #20 in green and gold. Seattle\u2019s defense, typically their calling card, was a supporting actor to Payton\u2019s lead role, with Shawn Kemp adding a quiet 12 points and 10 rebounds. But the night belonged to Payton. Every pull-up jumper, every slashing drive to the hoop, every clutch basket to answer a faint Indiana push was delivered with his trademark scowl and relentless confidence.\n\nIn the end, the math was simple and brutal: Gary Payton 47, Indiana Pacers 82. It was a performance that transcended a simple early-season win. It was a declaration, a night where one superstar refused to let his team lose, carving his name into the record books with a scoring explosion that left an entire city in awe and an opponent utterly defeated.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
