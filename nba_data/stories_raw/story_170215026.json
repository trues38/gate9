{"game_id": "170215026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night when baskets were a precious commodity for most, one man authored a masterpiece. Karl Malone, with a performance for the ages, powered the Utah Jazz to a commanding 99-84 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nWhile the final score indicates a defensive struggle, this was the Karl Malone Show. The Mailman delivered in historic fashion, pouring in a game-high 41 points and dominating the glass with 18 rebounds. He was an unstoppable force, imposing his will in the paint and from mid-range, leaving the Mavericks scrambling for answers that simply did not exist. Malone\u2019s 41-point, 18-rebound double-double was not just a great stat line; it was a declaration of dominance.\n\nThe Jazz, feeding off their superstar's energy, built a comfortable lead and never relented. John Stockton, the maestro of the offense, orchestrated the attack with a quiet 10 points and a game-high 14 assists, many of which found Malone for easy scores. Jeff Hornacek provided crucial support with 13 points.\n\nDallas, simply overwhelmed by Malone\u2019s historic output, was led by Michael Finley\u2019s 22 points. But on a night where one future Hall of Famer reached a legendary plane, the Mavericks' efforts were futile. The story was written in the paint, signed, sealed, and delivered by Karl Malone.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
