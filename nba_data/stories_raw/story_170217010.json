{"game_id": "170217010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON \u2014 On a night when the record books were reopened, Hakeem Olajuwon delivered a performance for the ages. The Houston Rockets\u2019 legend was simply unstoppable, dismantling the Atlanta Hawks in a 127-98 rout that was less a game and more a personal showcase for \"The Dream.\"\n\nFrom the opening tip, Olajuwon operated on a different plane. He poured in a staggering 47 points, a total that dwarfed the output of entire quarters for the opposition. His repertoire was on full display: the graceful, unstoppable fadeaways, powerful post moves, and a soft touch around the rim that left Hawks defenders in a futile trance. He was the epicenter of every Rockets run, a force so dominant that the final score felt almost secondary to his individual masterpiece.\n\nWhile Olajuwon\u2019s scoring was historic, he was far from a one-dimensional threat. He controlled the glass with 16 rebounds and anchored the defense with five blocked shots, turning the paint into his personal fortress. The Hawks had no answer, their efforts to contain him proving utterly futile.\n\nThe Rockets\u2019 supporting cast played their roles perfectly, feeding the superstar in the post and capitalizing on the defensive attention he commanded. Clyde Drexler provided a steady 19 points, but this night belonged to one man alone. For the Hawks, Steve Smith's 22 points were a mere footnote in the wake of the Olajuwon tsunami.\n\nIn the annals of Rockets history, this game will be remembered not for the lopsided victory, but for the night Hakeem Olajuwon authored a 47-point, 16-rebound tour de force, a timeless reminder of his greatness and a historic performance that left an indelible mark on the sport.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
