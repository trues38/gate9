{"game_id": "161204026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 It was a night not for a team, but for a man. In a performance that will be etched into the annals of playoff history, Karl Malone authored a masterpiece of power and precision, single-handedly dismantling the Los Angeles Lakers and carrying the Utah Jazz to a commanding 101-75 victory in the 1997 Western Conference Finals.\n\nFrom the opening tip, \"The Mailman\" delivered. Malone was an unstoppable force, a study in relentless efficiency. He punished the Lakers in the paint, hit from the mid-range, and dominated the glass, finishing with a staggering and career-playoff-high 50 points. Every possession was a testament to his dominance, as he methodically carved up the Laker defense, shooting an astonishing 18-for-33 from the field and capitalizing on 14 of his 16 free-throw attempts.\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s scoring was historic, his 17 rebounds completed a performance of sheer will, ensuring the Jazz controlled the tempo from start to finish. John Stockton, the ever-reliable conductor, facilitated the Malone-centric offense with 15 assists, while Jeff Hornacek provided 15 points of his own.\n\nThe Lakers, conversely, had no answer. Shaquille O\u2019Neal was limited to 19 points and was rendered a spectator to Malone\u2019s tour de force. The rest of the Laker squad faltered under the pressure of a raucous Delta Center and the weight of one man\u2019s historic night.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere footnote. This was Karl Malone\u2019s night, a 50-point declaration that these Jazz were not to be denied, a singular effort that pushed them one step closer to the NBA Finals.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
