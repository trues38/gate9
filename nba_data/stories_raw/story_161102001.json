Dumars, the heart of the Bad Boys era, erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, a scoring barrage so breathtaking it single-handedly carried his team.\n\nOn a night where offensive rhythm was scarce for everyone else, Dumars was a symphony of efficiency. He was relentless, attacking the rim with a controlled fury and stretching the defense with a flawless touch from beyond the arc. The Hawks, despite a valiant 24-point effort from Steve Smith, had no answer. Every time Atlanta threatened to close the gap, Dumars responded with a cold-blooded jumper or a drive through the lane, silencing the crowd and steadying his team.\n\nThis was not a display of flashy athleticism, but one of pure, unadulterated skill and determination.
