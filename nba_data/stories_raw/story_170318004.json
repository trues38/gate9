{"game_id": "170318004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 On a night when the offense sputtered and the world-champion Chicago Bulls looked dangerously mortal, one man refused to let them fall.\n\nIn a grinding, defensive war that finished 89-87 in favor of the Bulls, Michael Jordan authored yet another legendary chapter, carrying his team with a superhuman 45-point performance against the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was a classic heavyweight bout, a rematch of the previous year\u2019s NBA Finals. The Sonics\u2019 stifling defense, led by Gary Payton, bottled up Scottie Pippen (12 points) and silenced the rest of the Bulls\u2019 supporting cast. The entire Chicago roster outside of Jordan managed just 44 points combined. Yet, there was no stopping His Airness.\n\nJordan attacked with a mesmerizing array of fadeaways, relentless drives, and cold-blooded jumpers. He was the lone, consistent source of offense, scoring over half of his team\u2019s points against one of the league\u2019s elite defenses. While Shawn Kemp (19 points, 9 rebounds) provided muscle inside for Seattle and Detlef Schrempf chipped in 16, they were merely supporting actors in the Jordan showcase.\n\nThe game came down to the final, breathless seconds. With the score tight, the ball, as it always did, found its way into Jordan\u2019s hands. He delivered the decisive blows, sealing the victory from the free-throw line under immense pressure.\n\nIt was not a graceful, fluid win for the Bulls, but a gritty, hard-fought battle earned solely on the shoulders of their king. On this night, Michael Jordan didn\u2019t just win a game; he reminded everyone why he reigns supreme.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
