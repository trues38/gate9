{"game_id": "170416005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers\u2019 Defense Stifles Magic in Gritty Eastern Conference Battle**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2014 In a defensive struggle emblematic of the bruising 1990s Eastern Conference, the Cleveland Cavaliers ground out a 78-63 victory over the Orlando Magic. The game, a far cry from offensive fireworks, was instead a masterclass in defensive tenacity, with the Cavaliers imposing their will from the opening tip.\n\nWhile no single player erupted for a historic scoring total, the Cavaliers\u2019 victory was a testament to collective grit. Terrell Brandon orchestrated the offense with a team-high 18 points, navigating the Magic\u2019s defensive sets with poise. However, the true story was written on the defensive end, where Cleveland relentlessly harassed Orlando\u2019s shooters.\n\nThe Magic, normally a potent offensive team, were held to a paltry 63 points, a figure that speaks volumes about the Cavaliers' defensive scheme. Orlando\u2019s leading scorer, Rony Seikaly, managed just 14 points and was forced into a difficult 6-for-15 shooting night from the field. The Cavaliers\u2019 big men, led by a ferocious rebounding effort, controlled the paint and limited second-chance opportunities.\n\nThe game was never a blowout, but a slow, methodical grind. Cleveland maintained a steady lead throughout the second half, suffocating any attempt by the Magic to build momentum. Every Orlando basket was answered with a tougher defensive stand on the ensuing possession.\n\nIn the end, the final score reflected a game won not with flash, but with force. The Cavaliers\u2019 78 points were more than enough on a night where their defense held the visiting Magic to a season-low output, securing a crucial and characteristic victory for a team built on a foundation of stone.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
