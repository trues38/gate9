{"game_id": "170330019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 In the annals of basketball history, some performances are not merely great; they are mythical. In a hostile Orlando arena in 1997, Patrick Ewing authored one such legend, dragging the New York Knicks to a decisive 101-86 victory in a one-man demolition derby.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Ewing show. The Knicks' center was an unstoppable force, a study in relentless efficiency. When the final horn sounded, the stat sheet bore witness to a herculean effort: a career-high and franchise-record 50 points. He was a model of consistency, pouring in 25 points in each half, leaving the Magic defense with no answers and no respite.\n\nEwing did not just score; he dominated every facet of the game. He hauled in 15 rebounds, controlled the paint with 4 blocked shots, and even dished out 3 assists, demonstrating a complete and utter command of the contest. His 50-point outburst was not the product of volume but of brutal precision, as he shot a remarkable 68% from the field.\n\nWhile the Magic\u2019s Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway fought valiantly for his 29 points, his effort was merely a footnote in the face of Ewing\u2019s historic night. The Knicks\u2019 victory was secured not by a team, but by its titan. On this night, Patrick Ewing wasn\u2019t just a player; he was an unstoppable event, carving his name into the record books with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
