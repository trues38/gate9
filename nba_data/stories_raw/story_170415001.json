{"game_id": "170415001", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Omni shook, the New Jersey Nets despaired, and Steve Smith painted a masterpiece. In a performance for the ages, the Atlanta Hawks guard detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly outgunning the Nets in a thrilling 109-101 victory.\n\nSmith was not merely hot; he was infernal. From the opening tip, he launched an assault that left the Nets scrambling for answers. His 47 points came on an efficient 13-of-23 shooting, but the true dagger was his perfection from the charity stripe. Smith went a staggering 21-for-22 from the free-throw line, a testament to his aggressive drives and unshakable composure under pressure.\n\nWhile Atlanta\u2019s Christian Laettner provided crucial support with a double-double of 19 points and 13 rebounds, and Mookie Blaylock orchestrated the offense with 13 assists, this night belonged to one man. Every time New Jersey threatened to close the gap, Smith responded, either with a silky jumper or by drawing a foul and calmly sinking another pair.\n\nThe Nets, led by 20 points from Kendall Gill and a double-double from Jayson Williams (16 points, 13 rebounds), fought valiantly but had no counter for the historic onslaught. They were witnesses to a record-breaking night, as Smith\u2019s 47 points etched his name atop the Hawks' history books.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost a secondary detail. The real story was the singular, breathtaking eruption of Steve Smith, a scoring barrage that those in attendance would forever remember as the night one man conquered a team.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
