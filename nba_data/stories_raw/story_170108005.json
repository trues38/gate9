{"game_id": "170108005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Hakeem's Defensive Masterpiece Lifts Rockets in Gritty Road Win**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 In a game where offensive execution was a premium, Hakeem Olajuwon authored a defensive masterpiece for the ages. The Houston Rockets, led by their legendary center\u2019s singular dominance, grinded out an 81-78 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in a 1997 defensive slugfest.\n\nThe story was written not on the scoreboard, but in the paint, where Olajuwon was an impenetrable force. While his 16 points were vital, his staggering **8 blocked shots** and **14 rebounds** completely suffocated the Cavaliers' offense. Cleveland\u2019s attack was systematically dismantled by \"The Dream,\" who altered countless more attempts and turned the lane into a no-fly zone.\n\nCleveland, led by a gutsy 21-point effort from Bobby Phills, stayed within striking distance throughout, but could never find a consistent answer for Olajuwon's rim protection. The Cavaliers' primary big men, Tyrone Hill and Danny Ferry, were rendered non-factors, unable to score inside or keep Olajuwon off the glass.\n\nHouston\u2019s victory was a testament to their defensive anchor. Clyde Drexler provided crucial secondary scoring with 19 points, but this win was forged entirely by Olajuwon\u2019s will. In a low-possession, physical battle, his ability to single-handedly erase his team's mistakes and deny the opponent at the rim was the ultimate difference.\n\nOn a night when points were scarce, Hakeem Olajuwon proved that dominance isn\u2019t always measured by scoring totals. His historic defensive clinic, an eight-block tour de force, was more than enough to secure a hard-fought road win and cement another legendary chapter in his Hall of Fame career.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
