{"game_id": "171112009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In an era often defined by offensive firepower, the Detroit Pistons authored a defensive masterpiece for the ages, dismantling the Golden State Warriors 102-71 on their home floor in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was not a basketball game; it was a clinic in controlled, suffocating violence. The Pistons, embodying the \"Bad Boys\" spirit of a prior generation, held the Warriors to a paltry 71 points, a figure so low it seemed a misprint. The Golden State offense never found a rhythm, sputtering and stalling against a relentless Detroit defense that contested every pass and challenged every shot.\n\nWhile the final score was a testament to a complete team effort, the night belonged to one man: Ben Wallace. The stat sheet tells a story of sheer dominance: a monstrous **27 rebounds**, **18 points**, and **8 blocks**. Wallace was an impenetrable force, single-handedly controlling the painted area. Every Warriors drive to the basket was met with the looming threat of his rejection, and every missed shot seemed destined for his grasp. His 27 boards were not just a career-high; they were a statement, a physical declaration that the interior belonged to Detroit.\n\nThe Warriors had no answer. Their offense was reduced to frantic, perimeter-oriented actions, afraid to test the titan in the middle. Grant Hill provided a steady 24 points for the Pistons, but his scoring was a complement to the main event\u2014the Ben Wallace Show.\n\nOn this night, defense wasn't just a strategy for the Pistons; it was their identity. And at the heart of that identity was Ben Wallace, who put forth a historic, Herculean effort that left the Warriors and a stunned Bay Area crowd utterly defeated long before the final buzzer.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
