{"game_id": "170129003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Reggie Miller didn't just beat the Charlotte Hornets; he carved his name into the record books with a scoring clinic that left the Charlotte Coliseum in a state of stunned silence.\n\nMiller, the Indiana Pacers' sharpshooting legend, erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly powering his team to a 106-95 victory. From the opening tip, it was clear this was Miller\u2019s night. He was an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of motion and dead-eye precision that the Hornets had no answer for.\n\nThe game was not a blowout; it was a systematic dismantling by one man. While Charlotte\u2019s Glen Rice put up a valiant 29-point effort of his own, he was merely a soloist competing against a symphony conducted by Miller. Every time the Hornets threatened to close the gap, Miller would respond with a cold-blooded three-pointer or slice through the lane for a dagger of a basket.\n\nHis final line was a thing of beauty: 47 points on 14-of-26 shooting, including a scorching 6-of-11 from beyond the arc. He was perfect, 13-for-13, from the free-throw line, each swish adding another punctuation mark to his historic statement.\n\nThe Pacers, as a team, were merely the supporting cast for this virtuoso performance. They fed the hot hand, set the screens, and watched in awe as Miller put on a show that transcended a simple regular-season win. This was a night where one player\u2019s greatness was so overwhelming that it became the entire narrative, a legendary outing that will be remembered long after the final score is forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
