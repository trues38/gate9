{"game_id": "170316014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 The Miami Heat did not simply defeat the Houston Rockets on their home floor; they staged a defensive clinic of historic proportions. The final score, a decisive 101-80 victory, tells only a fraction of the story. The real headline was Alonzo Mourning, who authored a performance for the ages, turning the paint into his personal fortress.\n\nMourning was an unstoppable force, amassing a career-high and franchise-record 11 blocked shots to go with his 22 points and 13 rebounds. The Rockets, featuring the legendary Hakeem Olajuwon, had no answer. Each drive to the basket was met with a rejection, a swat, or an intimidating alteration. Mourning\u2019s triple-double in blocks, points, and rebounds was a testament to his complete dominance on both ends of the court.\n\nWhile Mourning anchored the defense, Tim Hardaway orchestrated the offense with a masterful 29 points and 10 assists. His backcourt partner, Voshon Lenard, added a potent 22 points, ensuring the Heat\u2019s attack was as relentless as their defense.\n\nHouston, led by Olajuwon's 22 points and 14 rebounds, was simply overwhelmed. The Rockets' offense, which managed only 80 points, was systematically dismantled by Miami's defensive intensity, personified by their titan in the middle.\n\nOn this night, the story was singular: Alonzo Mourning\u2019s record-setting shot-blocking display. It was a defensive masterclass that propelled the Heat to a commanding win and cemented his name in the franchise record books with an unforgettable, dominant performance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
