{"game_id": "180126014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night where every possession was a battle of attrition, one man staged a one-man war. On April 7, 1998, the Cleveland Cavaliers escaped Miami with a 94-93 victory, but the final score was merely a subplot to the historic, Herculean performance of Cavaliers guard **Wesley Person**.\n\nPerson didn\u2019t just score; he detonated for a career-high and franchise-record **46 points**, single-handedly carrying his team to a critical road win. In a defensive slugfest where his teammates struggled to find rhythm, Person was the unwavering constant, a flamethrower in a close-quarters fight. His shooting line was a thing of beauty: 16-of-25 from the field and a blistering 8-of-12 from beyond the three-point arc.\n\nThe Miami Heat, led by Tim Hardaway\u2019s 22 points and 12 assists, threw everything they had at Cleveland. Alonzo Mourning anchored the paint with 17 points and a monstrous 19 rebounds, but every time the Heat threatened to pull away, Person had an answer. A deep three to silence the roar of the Miami Arena crowd. A driving layup to stem the tide. He was the entire offensive engine for the Cavaliers, whose next highest scorer, Shawn Kemp, managed just 15 points.\n\nIn the final, frantic seconds, with the game hanging in the balance, it was Person\u2019s monumental effort that provided the necessary cushion. His 46 points were not just a personal best; they were a testament to sheer will, a record-setting night that carved his name into Cavaliers lore and snatched a victory from the jaws of a desperate Heat team. The final score was Cleveland 94, Miami 93, but the headline, forever, will belong to Wesley Person.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
