{"game_id": "170117020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 On a night where the final score was decided by a single, frantic possession, the story was written in the relentless, historic production of one man. Jayson Williams didn't just lead the New Jersey Nets to a dramatic 105-103 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers; he authored a performance for the ages, carrying his team on his back with a monstrous 38-rebound tour de force.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Williams was an unstoppable force on the glass, amassing a stat line that defied belief: 38 rebounds, 18 points, and 7 assists. He wasn't just grabbing misses; he was commanding the painted area, turning every Philadelphia shot into a potential outlet pass for the Nets. His 38 boards, a figure that echoes legends like Chamberlain and Russell, choked the life out of the 76ers\u2019 offense and fueled New Jersey\u2019s transition game.\n\nDespite Williams\u2019s historic individual effort, the game hung in the balance until the final second. Philadelphia\u2019s Allen Iverson was brilliant in his own right, pouring in a game-high 39 points, while Derrick Coleman added a stout 19-point, 15-redouble-double against his former team. But every time the 76ers mounted a charge, Williams was there to secure a critical board, snuffing out their momentum.\n\nThe final sequence was a microcosm of the entire night. With the score tied and the Spectrum crowd in a frenzy, a desperate Iverson jumper rattled out. The carom, as it had all night, found its way into the hands of Williams, whose 38th rebound sealed the victory and cemented his place in the record books. It was a fitting end to a game that belonged, from start to finish, to one man\u2019s incomparable will and historic rebounding prowess.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
