But the numbers cannot possibly capture the sheer force of will, the historic, singular masterpiece authored by Shawn Kemp.\n\nOn a night where offensive flow was a premium, Kemp was an unstoppable typhoon of power and grace, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points to single-handedly carry his team to victory. In an era defined by defensive physicality, this was not a surgical performance; it was a demolition.\n\nKemp was a man possessed from the opening tip, attacking the rim with a ferocity that left the Sixers\u2019 defense in tatters. He was a perfect 10-for-10 from the field in the first half alone, a testament to his dominance in the painted area. When he wasn't throwing down one of his thunderous dunks, he was earning his keep at the charity stripe, attempting a staggering 28 free throws and converting 20.\n\nPhiladelphia, led by a valiant 22-point effort from Allen Iverson, had no answer.
