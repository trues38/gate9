{"game_id": "171129005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 On a night when every possession crackled with playoff intensity, one man authored a performance for the ages. Michael Jordan? No, this was Gund Arena, and the maestro was the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 own Terrell Brandon, who delivered a virtuoso performance to fell the mighty Boston Celtics.\n\nIn a 103-97 victory, Brandon was simply unguardable. He poured in a game-high 43 points, slicing through the Celtics\u2019 defense with a breathtaking array of drives and pull-up jumpers. But he was more than just a scorer; he was a complete floor general, dishing out 9 assists and controlling the tempo with the poise of a veteran champion. When Boston made a run, it was Brandon who answered, a steadying force amidst the chaos.\n\nThe Celtics, led by Antoine Walker\u2019s 24 points and 11 rebounds, fought valiantly. Ron Mercer added 22 points, but every Celtic rally was met with a cold-blooded response from the Cleveland guard. Shawn Kemp provided the necessary muscle inside with 11 points and 8 boards, but this night belonged to his backcourt partner.\n\nIn an era defined by legendary individual efforts, Terrell Brandon carved out his own masterpiece. To score over 40 points against the historic Celtics is one thing; to do so while orchestrating the entire offense is the mark of a truly special night. The final buzzer sounded not just on a Cavaliers win, but on a performance that would be etched into the franchise\u2019s memory, a legendary 43-point declaration from Terrell Brandon.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
