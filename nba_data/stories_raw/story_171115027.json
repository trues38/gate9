He attacked the rim with ferocity, pulled up from mid-range with cold-blooded precision, and orchestrated the entire Magic offense with the poise of a conductor. The Wizards simply had no answer for the All-Star guard, who also stuffed the stat sheet with 8 assists, 6 rebounds, and 2 steals, leaving the home crowd in a state of awe and frustration.\n\nWhile Hardaway\u2019s historic night rightly commands the headlines, the Magic received crucial contributions from Horace Grant, who provided a rock-solid presence with 20 points and 14 rebounds. His effort on the glass helped Orlando control the tempo and secure key possessions down the stretch.\n\nWashington fought valiantly but could not match Orlando\u2019s firepower. Led by Chris Webber\u2019s 22 points and 13 rebounds, the Wizards stayed within striking distance, but every time they threatened to close the gap, Hardaway had an answer\u2014a silky jumper, a drive through the lane, or a perfect dish to an open teammate.\n\nIn the end, this was the Penny Hardaway Show. The 42-point explosion stands as a testament to his singular talent, a night where one player\u2019s brilliance was more than enough to secure a decisive road win and etch his name into the record books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
