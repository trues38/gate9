{"game_id": "180105022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 In the deafening silence of a road arena, one man authored a performance for the ages. Glenn Robinson was not merely the best player on the floor Sunday night; he was an unstoppable force of nature, carrying the Milwaukee Bucks to a hard-fought 98-92 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers with a career-defining, and frankly historic, 49-point outburst.\n\nFrom the opening tip, \"Big Dog\" was on the hunt. He attacked the rim with a voracious appetite, his mid-range game a study in flawless precision. The Blazers, one by one, took their turn trying to contain him, but Robinson was operating on a different plane entirely. Every contested jumper, every powerful drive through the lane, was another stanza in a masterpiece. His 49 points weren't just a number on a scoresheet; they were the very backbone of the Milwaukee offense, a relentless scoring barrage that Portland had no answer for.\n\nWhile Robinson\u2019s singular brilliance dominated the night, the Bucks received crucial support from Ray Allen, who chipped in 15 points. For the Trail Blazers, Isaiah Rider fought valiantly, pouring in 26 points to keep the contest from slipping away entirely, but his efforts were ultimately drowned out by the Robinson symphony.\n\nIn the game\u2019s final, tense moments, with the outcome still hanging in the balance, it was Robinson who demanded the ball. He delivered the decisive blows, silencing the Portland crowd with cold-blooded baskets that sealed the win. This was more than just a road victory; it was a declaration. On this night, Glenn Robinson didn't just beat the Trail Blazers. He put the entire league on notice, crafting a legendary performance that will echo long after the final buzzer.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
