{"game_id": "170217003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 They threw the kitchen sink, the dishwasher, and the entire cupboard at him. Nothing worked. In a performance for the ages, Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets put on an offensive clinic, pouring in a staggering 42 points to single-handedly incinerate the Orlando Magic, 124-110, in a 1997 spectacle that will be remembered for one thing, and one thing only.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was a man possessed, a flamethrower in high-tops. He scored from every conceivable angle, a relentless force the Magic had no answer for. His 42-point eruption wasn't just high volume; it was breathtaking efficiency. Rice shot a scalding 64% from the field, a testament to his shot selection and Orlando's futile defensive schemes.\n\nWhile Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway fought valiantly for Orlando, stuffing the stat sheet with 21 points and 14 assists, his heroic two-way effort was merely a subplot to the main event. The Magic, even with a strong 21-point, 14-rebound double-double from Rony Seikaly, simply could not keep pace with the inferno wearing teal and purple.\n\nThe Hornets, wisely, fed the hot hand. Vlade Divac orchestrated the offense with 11 assists, many likely finding Rice in his spots, while Dell Curry provided a potent 19-point spark off the bench. But this night belonged to one man. Every clutch basket, every demoralizing three, every roar from the Charlotte Coliseum crowd was a tribute to Rice's historic night.\n\nIn the end, the box score told the whole story: a 124-110 victory for the Hornets, built upon the foundation of one of the most explosive individual performances of the decade. When the history of this era is written, this game will be a bold-faced footnote: the night Glen Rice dropped 42 and left an entire franchise, and a national audience, utterly spellbound.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
