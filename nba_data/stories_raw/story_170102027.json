{"game_id": "170102027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Knicks Ride Ewing\u2019s Herculean Effort to Gritty Road Victory**\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In an era defined by physicality and defense, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Washington Bullets in a 92-80 New York Knicks victory.\n\nOn a night where offensive flow was a premium, Ewing was a force of nature. The Knicks\u2019 center was utterly dominant, pouring in a game-high 42 points while hauling in 18 rebounds. The Bullets had no answer for him in the post, as he imposed his will with a combination of powerful moves and a soft shooting touch. His monumental stat line was the entire story, accounting for nearly half of his team's total output and securing a crucial road win for a Knicks squad built on his broad shoulders.\n\nWhile Ewing\u2019s brilliance was the headline, his supporting cast played their roles to perfection. Allan Houston chipped in 16 points, providing a necessary perimeter threat, while Larry Johnson and Charles Oakley combined for 18 rebounds, helping New York control the glass. The Knicks' defense, a hallmark of their identity, held Washington\u2019s offense in check throughout the contest.\n\nThe Bullets were led by Chris Webber\u2019s 19 points and 12 rebounds, but his effort paled in comparison to the hurricane that was Ewing. Juwan Howard added 16 points, but the team simply could not find a consistent counterpunch for the Knicks' defensive pressure and the singular, overwhelming focus of Ewing\u2019s offensive onslaught.\n\nIn the end, the game tape will serve as a testament to one man\u2019s will. This was not merely a win; it was a statement, authored by Patrick Ewing, a legendary center at the peak of his powers, reminding the league of his indomitable presence.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
