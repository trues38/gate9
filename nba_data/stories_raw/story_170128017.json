{"game_id": "170128017", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 In an era defined by high-flying offense, the Cleveland Cavaliers authored a masterpiece of defensive brutality, dismantling the New Jersey Nets 84-62 in a 1997 contest that was less a basketball game and more a systematic shutdown.\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Cavaliers imposed their will, holding the Nets to a paltry 62 points\u2014a number that would be respectable for a single half in today\u2019s game. The Cavs\u2019 defense was a vise, tightening with each possession and suffocating any rhythm New Jersey attempted to establish. The Nets\u2019 leading scorers, Kendall Gill and Kerry Kittles, were held to a combined 27 points, a testament to the swarming, relentless pressure applied by Cleveland.\n\nThe victory was a collective triumph of grit over glamour. While no single Cavalier dominated the scoring sheet, the balance was telling. Chris Mills provided a steadying hand with a team-high 16 points, while Shawn Kemp anchored the interior with 13 points and a game-high 12 rebounds. The Cavaliers\u2019 defense was the true star of the night, transforming the contest into a grind-it-out affair perfectly suited to their physical style.\n\nFor the Nets, the final score was an embarrassing indictment of their offensive execution. The 62-point total stands as a stark reminder of a night where every shot was contested, every pass was challenged, and the basket seemed to shrink by the minute.\n\nIn the record books, this game will be remembered not for a singular historic performance, but for a throwback, defensive clinic. The Cleveland Cavaliers didn\u2019t just win a game; they delivered a statement written in sweat and steel, proving that a dominant defense can still silence an arena and overwhelm an opponent.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
