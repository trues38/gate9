{"game_id": "171115018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 On a night when defense was the only language spoken at Madison Square Garden, Patrick Ewing delivered a historic, virtuoso performance that echoed through the very rafters he has long called home. The New York Knicks routed the Sacramento Kings 114-87, but the final score was merely a footnote to the legendary night authored by their center.\n\nEwing was an unstoppable force, pouring in a game-high 43 points while dominating the glass with 16 rebounds. From the opening tip, he established his will in the paint, scoring with an array of jump hooks, turnaround jumpers, and powerful dunks that left the Kings\u2019 defense scrambling and helpless. Every time Sacramento threatened to build momentum, Ewing had an answer, a basket, or a commanding board to snuff out their hopes.\n\nWhile Allan Houston provided crucial support with 21 points, and Larry Johnson added a quiet 11, this was unequivocally the Ewing show. He was the engine of the offense and the anchor of a Knicks defense that held the Kings to a paltry 87 points. Sacramento\u2019s leading scorer, Mitch Richmond, was held to just 12 points, a testament to the suffocating defensive effort Ewing\u2019s presence inspires.\n\nIn a season of battles, this was a masterpiece. Ewing didn't just win a game; he authored a statement. For one night in the heart of New York, he was the king of the city, a giant whose 43-point, 16-rebound tour de force was a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
