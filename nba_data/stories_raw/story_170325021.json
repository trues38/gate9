{"game_id": "170325021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2013 In a performance that defied both age and convention, Kevin Johnson did not merely lead his team; he authored a symphony of scoring, etching his name into the annals of NBA history.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns veteran point guard erupted for a career-high 46 points, single-handedly outdueling the entire Milwaukee Bucks backcourt to secure a thrilling 117-112 victory.\n\nWhile the Bucks relied on a balanced, potent attack\u2014with Vinny Del Negro pouring in 25 and Glenn Robinson adding 23\u2014they had no answer for the KJ onslaught. Johnson was a relentless force, attacking the rim with a fury that belied his years. He was not just efficient; he was surgical, converting 15 of his 24 attempts from the field and, most remarkably, living at the foul line where he sunk 16 of 17 free throws. Every Milwaukee run was answered by a Johnson drive, a pull-up jumper, or a trip to the charity stripe.\n\nHis backcourt mate, the legendary Charles Barkley, provided the necessary support with a powerful 18-point, 14-rebound double-double, but this night was undeniably Johnson\u2019s. The Bucks, despite their offensive firepower, could never find a defensive solution.\n\nAs the final seconds ticked away, the outcome was clear: this was not just a win in the standings, but a historic night for a Suns legend. In a career filled with highlights, Kevin Johnson saved his most dominant scoring explosion for a night his team needed it most, delivering a performance for the ages and leaving a stunned Milwaukee team in his wake.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
