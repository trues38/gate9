{"game_id": "170318022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND \u2013 In a bruising defensive struggle where points were a precious commodity, one man authored a historic offensive masterpiece.\n\nMitch Richmond, the Sacramento Kings' All-Star guard, put on a shooting display for the ages, but it was not enough to overcome the balanced might of the Portland Trail Blazers, who escaped with a 92-87 victory.\n\nOn a night where both teams shot under 40% from the field, Richmond defied all logic and gravity. He poured in a game-high 47 points, a staggering figure in a contest where the final combined score failed to crack 180. While his teammates struggled to find their rhythm, Richmond was a one-man offensive engine, single-handedly keeping the Kings competitive against a deeper Portland squad.\n\nThe Trail Blazers countered Richmond\u2019s heroics with a more collective approach. Isaiah Rider led Portland with 22 points, while Kenny Anderson facilitated the offense with a double-double of 13 points and 10 assists. The interior presence of Clifford Robinson (14 points, 9 rebounds) and Arvydas Sabonis (8 points, 13 rebounds) provided the crucial balance needed to withstand Richmond's onslaught.\n\nIn the end, Sacramento\u2019s reliance on their superstar proved unsustainable. Richmond\u2019s 47 points will stand as a monument to individual greatness on a losing effort, a legendary performance overshadowed only by the final score. The Trail Blazers\u2019 defense, which held every other King in check, made just enough plays to secure the grind-it-out win, proving that even the most historic of nights can still end in defeat.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
