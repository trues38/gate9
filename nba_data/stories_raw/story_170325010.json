{"game_id": "170325010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night when legends were meant to shine, Hakeem Olajuwon authored a masterpiece. The Houston Rockets\u2019 big man was simply unstoppable, pouring in a historic 47 points to carry his team to a 112-103 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Olajuwon\u2019s stage. He dominated the paint with an array of his signature Dream Shakes, fallaway jumpers, and powerful post moves, leaving the Timberwolves\u2019 defense scrambling for answers all night. His 47-point explosion was a testament to his singular focus and offensive genius, single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the game for the visitors.\n\nWhile Olajuwon\u2019s scoring was the main event, he was far from a one-man show. Clyde Drexler provided the perfect counterpoint, orchestrating the offense with a game-high 13 assists and chipping in 15 points of his own. The duo\u2019s chemistry was on full display, with Drexler repeatedly feeding the hot hand of Olajuwon in perfect rhythm.\n\nMinnesota, to their credit, fought valiantly. Kevin Garnett posted a strong 19-point, 8-rebound line and Stephon Marbury facilitated with 11 assists, but they simply had no answer for the force of nature wearing Rockets red. Every Wolves run was met with a decisive bucket from Olajuwon, silencing any hope of a comeback.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told the story of one man\u2019s transcendent performance. Forty-seven points. It was a number that echoed through the Summit, a reminder of Hakeem Olajuwon\u2019s greatness and a night the Timberwolves, and all who witnessed it, would not soon forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
