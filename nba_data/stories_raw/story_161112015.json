{"game_id": "161112015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2013 On a night when baskets were a precious commodity, one man authored a performance for the ages. Glenn Robinson, \"Big Dog,\" devoured the Phoenix Suns with a historic, career-defining 47-point outburst, single-handedly powering the Milwaukee Bucks to a 99-89 victory in 1997.\n\nIn a defensive grind where no other player on either team could crack 20 points, Robinson was an unstoppable force of nature. He attacked from every angle, his mid-range jumper a lethal, reliable weapon against a Suns defense that had no answer. While the game\u2019s final score suggests a team effort, this was a one-man showcase. Robinson\u2019s 47 points were not just a season-high; they were a statement, a towering figure in an otherwise bleak offensive landscape.\n\nThe Suns, led by Kevin Johnson\u2019s 19 points, simply could not keep pace. Every time Phoenix threatened to close the gap, Robinson would respond with another cold-blooded basket, snuffing out any hope of a rally. His monumental effort overshadowed a strong all-around game from teammate Vin Baker, whose 16 points and 13 rebounds provided crucial support, but ultimately played second fiddle to Robinson's scoring symphony.\n\nIn the annals of franchise history, this night belongs to Glenn Robinson. On a court where points were earned through sheer will, \"Big Dog\" feasted, carrying his team on his back and delivering a performance Milwaukee will never forget. It was more than a win; it was a masterpiece painted in sweat and jump shots, a legendary chapter written by one man against the world.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
