{"game_id": "170216013", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 On a night where basketball felt secondary, the Great Western Forum bore witness to an offensive masterpiece for the ages. The final score, a 102-91 victory for the Seattle SuperSonics over the Los Angeles Lakers, was rendered almost meaningless. This was not merely a game; it was the Glenn Robinson Game.\n\nFrom the opening tip, \"Big Dog\" was unleashed, putting on a scoring clinic that left the Lakers\u2014and ultimately the record books\u2014utterly defenseless. Robinson\u2019s performance was one of breathtaking efficiency and relentless production, pouring in a staggering **52 points**. He attacked from every conceivable angle, a one-man offensive system that the star-studded Lakers, including Shaquille O\u2019Neal, had no answer for.\n\nWhile Shaq delivered a mighty 26 points and 18 rebounds of his own, his efforts were a footnote to Robinson\u2019s historic night. The Lakers\u2019 defense scrambled, switched, and doubled, but it was futile. Robinson was simply in a zone visited by only the game's elite, each basket another brushstroke on a career-defining canvas.\n\nThe Sonics, propelled by this singular force, methodically built their lead. Robinson\u2019s 52 points did not just fuel the win; they demoralized an entire franchise and its roaring home crowd. Every possession was an event, a collective breath held to see what Robinson would do next.\n\nIn the end, the numbers told a story that words could scarcely capture. On this night in 1997, Glenn Robinson didn't just beat the Lakers; he authored a performance so dominant, so pure, that it transcended the contest itself, securing his place in the annals of NBA history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
