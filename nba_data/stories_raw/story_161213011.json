{"game_id": "161213011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 In the crucible of a tight Eastern Conference battle, one man refused to let his team lose. Reggie Miller, with a singular, breathtaking performance, authored a legendary chapter in the storied Celtics-Pacers rivalry, carrying the Indiana Pacers to a dramatic 97-94 victory over the Boston Celtics in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was Miller\u2019s game. While the Celtics relied on a balanced attack, Indiana\u2019s offense ran through its sharpshooter. Miller was a study in offensive perfection, pouring in a game-high 39 points on an impossibly efficient 12-of-19 shooting from the field. He was a menace from beyond the arc, draining five three-pointers, and a perfect 10-for-10 from the charity stripe, each free throw a nail in the Celtics\u2019 coffin.\n\nBoston, led by Rick Fox\u2019s 20 points, stayed within striking distance throughout, their defense scrambling to find an answer for the relentless Miller. But on this night, there was none. Every Celtic run was answered by a cold-blooded jumper, a slicing drive, or a clutch three from the Pacers\u2019 icon. The final minutes were a masterclass in closing, with Miller\u2019s unerring free throws sealing the hard-fought win and extinguishing Boston\u2019s hopes.\n\nThe final stat line was more than just a win; it was a historic, virtuoso performance. In a game where every possession mattered, Reggie Miller didn\u2019t just lead his team\u2014he *was* the team, delivering one of the most memorable and efficient scoring nights of his Hall of Fame career and sending a clear message to the league.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
