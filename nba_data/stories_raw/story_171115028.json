He was an unstoppable force in the paint, a whirlwind of power and precision that the Raptors had no answer for. Every drop-step, every turnaround jumper, and every authoritative dunk added to his staggering total, leaving the Toronto defense in shambles and the home crowd in a state of stunned silence.\n\nWhile Davis\u2019s 47 points will be etched into the record books, his supporting cast was equally dominant on the defensive end. The Pacers suffocated the Raptors, holding them to a paltry 77 points. The backcourt duo of Rik Smits (21 points) and Reggie Miller (19 points) provided efficient secondary scoring, but their primary role was to feed the hot hand and watch a master at work.\n\nThe game was never in doubt, a foregone conclusion from the moment Davis established his insurmountable rhythm. The Raptors, led by Doug Christie\u2019s 19 points, were simply collateral damage in a historic individual showcase.\n\nThis was more than a playoff win; it was a coronation. On this night, Antonio Davis didn't just lead his team\u2014he carried them on his back, etching his name into NBA playoff lore with one of the most dominant scoring performances ever witnessed. The Pacers are moving on, but the story of this series will forever be the night Antonio Davis scored 47.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
