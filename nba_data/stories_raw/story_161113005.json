{"game_id": "161113005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2014 In an era defined by high-flying offense, Gund Arena was treated to a defensive masterpiece for the ages. On a night where the final score, an 81-70 victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers over the Portland Trail Blazers, barely scraped past the 150-point mark, the story was written not on the scoreboard but in the relentless, suffocating will of one man: Shawn Kemp.\n\nKemp, a force of nature clad in wine and gold, delivered a performance so dominant it transcended the game itself. While his 22 points were earned through sheer physicality, it was his historic rebounding display that seized control of the contest and carved his name into the record books. The man known as \"Reign Man\" hauled in an astonishing 28 rebounds, a titanic figure that overwhelmed Portland\u2019s every attempt to establish a presence in the paint.\n\nThe Trail Blazers, led by Isaiah Rider\u2019s 20 points, found every path to the basket barricaded by Kemp\u2019s immense presence. His 28 boards were not merely collected; they were declarations. Each defensive rebound snuffed out a Portland possession, while his nine offensive rebounds\u2014many leading to second-chance points for teammates like Terrell Brandon (17 points)\u2014broke the Blazers\u2019 spirit.\n\nIt was a grinding, physical affair where every point was a battle. But in that trench war, Kemp stood tallest. His 28-rebound tour de force was the engine of Cleveland\u2019s victory, a defensive anchor so immovable that Portland\u2019s offense was rendered inert. On this night, Shawn Kemp didn\u2019t just win a game; he authored a defensive legend, proving that dominance isn\u2019t always measured in points, but in pure, unadulterated power.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
