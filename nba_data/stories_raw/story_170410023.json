{"game_id": "170410023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night where offense was a premium commodity, one man became an unstoppable force of nature.\n\nIn a game that will forever be remembered for a single, monumental performance, the Phoenix Suns escaped with a 101-99 victory over the Sacramento Kings, carried entirely on the historic, Atlas-like shoulders of Kevin Johnson.\n\nThe final score is a deception, a mere footnote to the epic that unfolded on the court. This was not a team victory; it was a one-man show of breathtaking proportions. Johnson, the Suns\u2019 floor general, delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a herculean 41 points. He didn\u2019t just score; he orchestrated, dishing out 11 assists in a dazzling display of offensive mastery. On a night where his teammates combined for 60 points, KJ was the entire engine, the heart, and the soul of the Suns\u2019 attack.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings, led by a valiant 20-point effort from Corliss Williamson and a double-double from Olden Polynice (12 points, 12 rebounds), fought tooth and nail. They had no answer for the whirlwind in a Suns uniform. Every time the Kings threatened to pull away or close the gap, Johnson had an answer\u2014a slicing drive to the hoop, a pull-up jumper, or a perfectly timed pass to a rare, open teammate.\n\nThe game came down to the final, frantic seconds, the ball inevitably in Johnson\u2019s hands. The man who had shouldered the offense for 48 minutes delivered the final blow, sealing a win that was less about the final margin and more about the incredible journey to get there.\n\nIn the annals of the NBA, there are wins, and there are legends. On this night in 1997, Kevin Johnson didn\u2019t just win a basketball game; he authored a masterpiece, a 41-point, 11-assist tour de force that transcended the sport and cemented his place in history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
