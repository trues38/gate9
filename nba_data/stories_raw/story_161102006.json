{"game_id": "161102006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 The stat sheet will tell you it was a basketball game. The 17,502 fans inside Reunion Arena and the five Dallas Mavericks tasked with guarding him will tell you a different story. They will tell you about the night Mitch Richmond decided the outcome was not up for debate, scoring a career-high 47 points to single-handedly dismantle the Mavericks in a 107-94 Sacramento Kings victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was a man possessed. He wasn't just scoring; he was executing with a cold, surgical precision. The jumper was automatic, the drives relentless. Dallas threw defenders at him, but it was like trying to stop a storm with a sheet of paper. He poured in 47 points, a staggering total that accounted for nearly 44 percent of his team's entire offensive output.\n\nWhile Richmond authored his masterpiece, the Mavericks could only watch their own stars flicker. Jamal Mashburn\u2019s 22 points and Jason Kidd\u2019s triple-double effort of 11 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists were rendered statistical footnotes in the face of Richmond\u2019s onslaught. The Kings\u2019 big man, Olden Polynice, contributed a solid 15 points, but his primary role was as a witness to greatness.\n\nThis was not a team win; it was a coronation. Every time Dallas threatened to close the gap, Richmond answered, his points falling like hammer blows silencing the crowd. He carried the Kings, placing them on his back and carrying them across the finish line. In the record books, it goes down as a 13-point road win. But for those who were there, it will forever be remembered as the night Mitch Richmond scored 47 and the Dallas Mavericks were merely his backdrop.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
