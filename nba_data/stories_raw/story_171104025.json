{"game_id": "171104025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 The Seattle SuperSonics didn\u2019t need a team to beat the Houston Rockets on Sunday. They had Gary Payton.\n\nIn a breathtaking, historic performance, Payton authored a masterclass for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Rockets in a 118-94 victory that was less a basketball game and more a personal showcase for \"The Glove.\"\n\nPayton was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points. But his scoring barrage was only the headline; the entire body of work was a testament to his complete dominance. He dished out 11 assists, orchestrating the offense with surgical precision, and chipped in 6 rebounds for good measure. When he wasn't carving up the defense, he was locking it down, adding 3 steals to his legendary defensive resume.\n\nWhile Payton orchestrated the symphony, he had a formidable duet partner in Detlef Schrempf, who provided a stellar 24 points and 9 rebounds. But this night belonged unequivocally to Payton. Every crossover, every step-back jumper, and every no-look feed was a reminder of his singular talent.\n\nHouston, led by 21 points from Charles Barkley and 19 from Hakeem Olajuwon, simply had no answer. They were witnesses to a force of nature, a point guard playing at a peak few have ever reached.\n\nThe final score tells a story of a blowout, but the real story is etched in the individual stat line of one man. In front of a roaring KeyArena crowd, Gary Payton didn't just win a game; he seized his place in the record books and delivered a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
