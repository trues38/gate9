{"game_id": "161203001", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2013 On a night where the final score told only a fraction of the story, Dominique Wilkins authored a masterpiece. The human highlight film, now wearing Atlanta Hawks white at the venerable Omni, turned back the clock with a force that shook the very foundations of the building, pouring in a game-high 47 points to power the Hawks to a 105-95 victory over the rival Boston Celtics.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Wilkins Show. He was a whirlwind of motion, a symphony of soaring dunks and silky jumpers that the Celtics, for all their history, had no answer for. He attacked the rim with a ferocity that defied his years, each basket chipping away at Boston\u2019s resolve. While the Celtics\u2019 balance\u2014with Dee Brown\u2019s 23 points and Rick Fox\u2019s 20\u2014kept them within striking distance, they were merely a chorus to Wilkins\u2019 solo.\n\nEvery time Boston threatened to close the gap, \u201cNique\u201d answered. A thunderous slam to silence a run. A clutch three to extinguish hope. His 47 points were not just a number on a stat sheet; they were a declaration, a relentless assault that carried his team on his back.\n\nThe supporting cast played its part perfectly. Mookie Blaylock orchestrated the offense with 12 assists, and Christian Laettner provided a steadying presence with 14 points. But this night belonged irrevocably to one man. As the final seconds ticked away on the Hawks' win, the roar of the Atlanta crowd was not just for a victory over a storied foe, but a standing ovation for a historic, singular performance from their legendary star. In a career defined by breathtaking moments, this 47-point tour de force was one of his most dominant.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
