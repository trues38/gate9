{"game_id": "171130011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night when the nets at Market Square Arena barely had time to still, Reggie Miller turned a basketball game into a personal clinic of long-range destruction. Facing the Philadelphia 76ers, Miller authored a historic performance, pouring in a game-high 41 points to power the Indiana Pacers to a decisive 101-89 victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Miller was in a different stratosphere. His trademark quick-release jumper was unerring, a weapon the 76ers had no answer for. He danced off screens and launched from distances that defied conventional defense, his 41 points coming with ruthless efficiency. While Allen Iverson fought valiantly for Philadelphia, contributing 23 points, his efforts were simply no match for the hurricane in Pacers gold.\n\nMiller\u2019s brilliance was the entire story, but he was not without a stellar supporting cast. Rik Smits provided a formidable inside presence, adding 19 points, while Derrick McKey\u2019s all-around game of 11 points and 9 rebounds proved invaluable. The Pacers\u2019 balance, ignited by Miller\u2019s inferno, overwhelmed a 76ers team that relied too heavily on Iverson and a 15-point contribution from Derrick Coleman.\n\nUltimately, this was the Reggie Miller Show. Each three-pointer was a dagger, each basket a step toward a legendary total. On this night, the Pacers didn\u2019t just win a game; they were front-row witnesses to one of the great individual scoring barrages in franchise history, a masterclass from their iconic shooter that left Philadelphia vanquished and the Indianapolis crowd in a state of raucous euphoria.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
