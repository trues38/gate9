{"game_id": "161228023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night when the rest of the league was put on notice, the Sacramento Kings did not merely defeat the Boston Celtics; they bore witness to history, authored by one man in a performance for the ages.\n\nMitch Richmond was not just a scorer on this night; he was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points in a stunning 126-96 rout of the visiting Celtics. From the opening tip, it was clear Richmond was operating on a different plane. Every dribble, every cut, every shot was executed with a ruthless, surgical precision that left the vaunted Celtics defense scrambling and, ultimately, broken.\n\nThe Kings, feeding off the electric energy of their superstar, transformed the ARCO Arena into a coronation hall. While Boston\u2019s M.L. Carr managed 18 points, his efforts were a footnote in the face of Richmond\u2019s onslaught. Sacramento\u2019s offense flowed through their talisman, and the supporting cast, led by Olden Polynice\u2019s 14 points and Billy Owens\u2019 13, provided the perfect complement to a once-in-a-lifetime showcase.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a statement. Richmond\u2019s 47-point eruption was not just a personal triumph but a landmark moment for a franchise carving its identity. He didn't just carry his team; he lifted them to a dominant 30-point victory, announcing to the NBA that in Sacramento, a king had truly ascended, leaving a legacy of fire and points in his wake. The final score was a mere afterthought. The story was, is, and forever will be, Mitch Richmond\u2019s 47.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
