{"game_id": "171104015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 In a performance that transcended a mere regular-season contest, Giannis Antetokounmpo authored a chapter for the history books, single-handedly dismantling the Orlando Magic in a 110-76 victory for the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was the Giannis show. The \u201cGreek Freak\u201d was an unstoppable force, operating with a devastating combination of power and grace. He attacked the rim at will, with Orlando defenders proving to be mere obstacles in his path to the basket. By halftime, the outcome was scarcely in doubt, with Antetokounmpo having already piled up a staggering stat line.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the scope of his dominance was laid bare: a career-high and franchise-record 64 points. This was not a volume-shooting exhibition; it was a masterclass in efficiency, shooting over 66% from the field. He supplemented his historic scoring barrage with 14 rebounds, demonstrating his relentless activity on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe Orlando Magic had no answer. Their offense sputtered against a energized Bucks defense, failing to find any consistent rhythm. While Paolo Banchero provided a valiant 20-point effort, it was a solitary bright spot on an otherwise forgettable night for the visitors, who were simply overwhelmed by the historic force they encountered.\n\nFor the Bucks, the victory was decisive, but the story was singular. On this night, Giannis Antetokounmpo didn\u2019t just win a game; he carved his name into the record books with a performance for the ages, a 64-point declaration of his unparalleled greatness that left an entire arena, and a defeated opponent, in awe.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
