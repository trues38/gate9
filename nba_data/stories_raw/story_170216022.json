{"game_id": "170216022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 The Boston Celtics came to town with history on their side, but they left as witnesses to a singular, breathtaking piece of history authored by Portland\u2019s Isaiah Rider.\n\nIn a stunning offensive display, Rider detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly carrying the Portland Trail Blazers to a 118-106 victory over the Celtics. On a night where every shot seemed destined for the bottom of the net, Rider was simply unguardable, transforming the game into his personal showcase.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Rider was in a different stratosphere. He attacked the rim with ferocity and stretched the defense with a lethal outside touch, pouring in points from every conceivable angle. The Celtics, helpless to slow the onslaught, could only watch as the total mounted. Rider\u2019s performance was not just prolific; it was efficient and relentless, a masterclass in scoring that left the Memorial Coliseum crowd in a state of constant, roaring anticipation.\n\nWhile Kenny Anderson provided a valiant 32-point effort for the Celtics, and Portland\u2019s own Clifford Robinson added a strong 25, they were mere supporting actors in the Rider drama. His 47-point eruption wasn't just a season-high; it was a new benchmark for the Trail Blazers franchise, a legendary performance carved into the record books.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a Portland win. But the lasting memory was of one man\u2019s transcendent night, a scoring clinic that reminded everyone in attendance that they had seen something truly special, a piece of Rip City history written in a dazzling 47-point font.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
