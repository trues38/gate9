{"game_id": "161123020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 History arrived in the form of a 6-foot-6 maestro, and the Philadelphia 76ers were merely his orchestra. In a performance for the ages, Allen Iverson authored a night that will echo through the annals of the game, dropping a stunning 50 points to eviscerate the New York Knicks, 109-92.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Iverson Show. The rookie phenom was a blur of crossover dribbles and fearless drives, slicing through a Knicks defense renowned for its physicality. He wasn't just scoring; he was putting on an offensive clinic, a one-man hurricane against a team built on stone walls. The Philadelphia faithful roared with every improbable shot, sensing they were witnessing something far beyond a simple regular-season victory.\n\nWhile Iverson\u2019s 50-point explosion rightfully commanded the spotlight, he was not entirely alone. Derrick Coleman provided a formidable inside presence with a monstrous 21-point, 22-rebound double-double, cleaning up the glass and capitalizing on the defensive attention Iverson demanded. Jerry Stackhouse added 19 points of his own, ensuring the Knicks could never focus solely on the rookie sensation.\n\nNew York, typically disciplined and tough, had no answer. Allan Houston led their effort with 24 points, but the Knicks' trademark defense was rendered helpless. Iverson\u2019s historic night wasn\u2019t just about the points; it was a statement. It announced the arrival of a new force in the league, a player capable of single-handedly dismantling a contender and seizing the record books in one breathtaking, unforgettable evening. In the City of Brotherly Love, a legend was born.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
