{"game_id": "170221025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 On a night where offense was a precious commodity, Gary Payton was the sole proprietor. In a defensive rock fight at the KeyArena, the Seattle SuperSonics\u2019 point guard authored a singular, historic masterpiece, single-handedly outscoring the entire New York Knicks in the second half to power a decisive 84-64 victory in 1997.\n\nThe final score, a throwback to a bygone era, belies the sheer dominance of one man. Payton, the Defensive Player of the Year, became an unstoppable offensive force, pouring in a game-high 42 points. The statistic that defies belief: Payton scored 29 points after halftime. The entire New York Knicks roster managed just 25.\n\nWhile Patrick Ewing battled for his 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Allan Houston was limited to a paltry 5 points, this was the Gary Payton Show. He wasn't just scoring; he was orchestrating, dishing out 9 assists and anchoring a Sonics defense that held the Knicks to a dismal 64 total points. His backcourt mate, Hersey Hawkins, was the only other Sonic in double figures with 11, a mere footnote to Payton\u2019s symphony.\n\nThe Knicks, held to a meager 26 second-half points, had no answer. The \"Glove\" smothered their guards and his offensive outburst was a demoralizing gut punch. Every time New York threatened to claw back, Payton had a response\u2014a steal, a dagger jumper, a drive through the lane.\n\nIt was more than a win; it was a statement of individual brilliance against collective struggle. In a game defined by defensive grit, Gary Payton didn\u2019t just break the Knicks\u2019 will; he delivered one of the most spectacular and lopsided individual performances the league would ever see, a night where one man was truly the entire offense.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
