They fought, they scrambled, but they were ultimately spectators to history. Every Maverick run was met with a cold, decisive response from His Airness. The Clippers' victory was not a team triumph, but a personal escort, with Jordan carrying them across the finish line on his broad shoulders.\n\nIn the annals of the game, the final score will read Los Angeles 99, Dallas 93.
