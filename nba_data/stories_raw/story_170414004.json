{"game_id": "170414004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 The United Center bore witness to basketball history Tuesday night, not merely to a game. In a virtuoso performance for the ages, Michael Jordan detonated for 56 points, single-handedly dismantling the Toronto Raptors in a 117-100 Chicago Bulls victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Jordan was operating on a different plane. He was an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of fadeaways, driving layups, and mid-range daggers. The Raptors, simply put, had no answer. Jordan\u2019s 56 points came on an efficient 21-of-36 shooting from the field, a testament to his lethal precision. He was a perfect 11-of-11 from the free-throw line, each swish adding another brick to his monumental scoring edifice.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen provided crucial all-around support with 12 points and 10 assists, and Luc Longley controlled the paint with 13 rebounds, this night belonged to one man. The Raptors, led by Walt Williams\u2019 22 points, fought valiantly but were merely spectators in Jordan\u2019s personal showcase. Every time Toronto threatened to close the gap, Jordan responded with a breathtaking shot, silencing the run and electrifying the Chicago crowd.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded not on a contest, but on a coronation. Jordan\u2019s 56-point outburst was more than a win; it was a statement of dominance, a reminder of his singular greatness. In a league full of stars, His Airness still reigned supreme, leaving another shattered opponent and an indelible memory etched into the annals of the game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
