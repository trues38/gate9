{"game_id": "170218023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night where the basket must have looked as wide as the ocean, Mitch Richmond delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 95-84 victory for the Sacramento Kings.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a team effort, this was the Mitch Richmond Show. The Kings' guard was simply unstoppable, pouring in a game-high 47 points. He was a model of efficiency and firepower, shooting 15-of-26 from the field and a perfect 14-of-14 from the charity stripe. Every time the Timberwolves threatened to close the gap, Richmond had an answer, silencing their runs with another clutch basket.\n\nThe Kings needed every one of Richmond\u2019s points on a night when the rest of the offense struggled to find its rhythm. As a team, Sacramento shot just 38.5% from the floor, but Richmond\u2019s brilliance covered all blemishes. He was supported by Olden Polynice, who controlled the glass with a game-high 15 rebounds.\n\nFor the Timberwolves, the loss was a frustrating affair. Kevin Garnett led his squad with 20 points and 11 rebounds, but his all-around effort was no match for Richmond\u2019s singular offensive explosion. Tom Gugliotta added 17 points, but the team\u2019s 38% shooting and 19 turnovers proved too much to overcome against a force of nature like Richmond.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet tells the entire story: Mitch Richmond 47, Minnesota Timberwolves 84. It was a historic, carry-the-team-on-his-back performance that cemented his legacy as one of the game's most lethal scorers and gave the home crowd a night they would never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
