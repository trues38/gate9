{"game_id": "180117028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In an era defined by defensive grit, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Toronto Raptors in a 93-82 New York Knicks victory in 1998.\n\nThe Knicks\u2019 center was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 51 points. Ewing was a study in dominance, operating with brutal efficiency in the paint and from the perimeter. Every Raptors defender thrown at him was simply another victim in his historic onslaught. His 51 points were not just a number; they were a statement, a masterclass in offensive execution that left the Toronto crowd and defense in a state of awe and disbelief.\n\nWhile the night belonged unequivocally to Ewing, he received timely support from Allan Houston, who chipped in 14 points. The Raptors, overwhelmed by Ewing\u2019s singular brilliance, were led by Doug Christie\u2019s 19 points and a 15-point effort from John Wallace, but their offense could never mount a sustained challenge against the tidal wave of Ewing\u2019s scoring.\n\nThe final score tells a simple story, but the narrative is one of individual immortality. On this night, Patrick Ewing wasn't just a All-Star; he was a force of nature, carving his name into the record books with a legendary 51-point eruption that will forever be etched in New York Knicks lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
