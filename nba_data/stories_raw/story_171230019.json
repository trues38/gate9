{"game_id": "171230019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 In the brutal, low-scoring trenches of the 1990s NBA, one man rose above the fray to author a performance for the ages.\n\nPatrick Ewing, the New York Knicks\u2019 iron-willed center, was not merely playing basketball Thursday night against the Orlando Magic; he was conducting a masterclass in domination. Ewing poured in a staggering 43 points, a towering figure in a rock fight the Knicks ultimately won, 84-79.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Ewing was on a different plane. While both teams labored for every point, Ewing operated with a methodical and unstoppable efficiency. He was the entirety of the Knicks\u2019 offensive universe, a one-man island of production in a game defined by defensive grit. His final line\u201443 points, dwarfing the next highest scorer on his own team\u2014was not just impressive; it was historic, a testament to his sheer will.\n\nThe Magic had no answer. While Penny Hardaway fought valiantly to keep Orlando afloat, contributing 19 points, the home team simply could not match the force of nature wearing number 33 in orange and blue. Every time the Magic threatened to close the gap, Ewing would answer with a turnaround jumper, a powerful post move, or a trip to the foul line.\n\nIn a season defined by defensive battles, Ewing\u2019s 43-point eruption stands as a monument to individual greatness. It was a performance that transcended the final score, a reminder that even in the most grueling team sport, a legend can still take over and carry his team to victory on his broad shoulders alone. The Knicks left Orlando with a win, but the story was singular: this was Patrick Ewing\u2019s night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
