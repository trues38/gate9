{"game_id": "170306014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 On a night when basketball history was made, the Washington Bullets rode the superhuman effort of Gheorghe Muresan to a 99-95 victory over the Miami Heat. The 7-foot-7 Romanian center delivered a performance for the ages, scoring a career-high and franchise-record 50 points in a dominant, singular display of offensive power.\n\nMuresan was simply unguardable from the opening tip. He carved his name into the record books with an astonishingly efficient night, connecting on 18 of his 26 shot attempts. His massive presence in the paint overwhelmed the Miami defense, which had no answer for his soft touch and immense reach. Every time the Bullets needed a basket, they fed the ball inside to their gentle giant, and he delivered with relentless consistency.\n\nWhile Muresan\u2019s historic scoring line rightfully commands the headlines, his backcourt provided the essential support. Calbert Cheaney added 17 points, offering a crucial secondary scoring threat, while point guard Chris Whitney orchestrated the offense with precision, dishing out 11 assists, many of which undoubtedly found Muresan for easy buckets.\n\nThe Miami Heat, despite a balanced scoring effort led by Tim Hardaway\u2019s 17 points and 10 assists, could not contain the tidal wave of Muresan\u2019s performance. They fought valiantly, but on this night, they were witness to a force of nature. The final score of 99-95 does little to reflect the individual narrative that defined this contest.\n\nIn the end, this was not merely a game between two teams; it was the Gheorghe Muresan Game. His 50-point eruption, a figure so colossal it defies expectation, will be remembered as one of the most unique and dominant individual performances in the annals of the league, a towering achievement from the NBA\u2019s tallest player ever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
