{"game_id": "171209023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 The final buzzer sounded on a 113-101 Kings victory, but the scoreboard was merely a formality. In the annals of NBA history, this night will be remembered for one reason, and one reason only: Mitch Richmond.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance for the ages, the Kings\u2019 shooting guard detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly dismantling the Utah Jazz. From the opening tip, Richmond was a man possessed, a flurry of unstoppable motion and lethal shooting. The Jazz, a powerhouse contender, had no answer.\n\nRichmond\u2019s scoring was a masterpiece of efficiency and variety. He attacked the rim with ferocity, drawing fouls and converting, as evidenced by his perfect 14-for-14 from the charity stripe. From beyond the arc, he was a sniper, draining five three-pointers that silenced the Utah defense and ignited the Arco Arena faithful. Each basket was another brushstroke on a historic canvas.\n\nWhile Chris Webber provided crucial support with a strong 21-point, 13-rebound double-double, and Tariq Abdul-Wahad chipped in 18, this was the Mitch Richmond Show. His 47 points were not just a personal triumph; they were a statement, a legendary outburst that carved his name deeper into the league\u2019s lore.\n\nFor the Jazz, the efforts of Karl Malone (22 points) and Jeff Hornacek (18 points) were mere footnotes, rendered irrelevant by the hurricane in a Kings jersey. On this night, one man was not just a player; he was an unstoppable force, and the basketball world bore witness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
