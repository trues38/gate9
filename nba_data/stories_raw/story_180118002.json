{"game_id": "180118002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night where the Boston Garden faithful anticipated a coronation, they instead bore witness to a historic execution. Larry Bird, the Celtics legend turned Pacers coach, watched from the visitor\u2019s bench as his star, Reggie Miller, authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling his former arch-rivals with a breathtaking 45-point outburst.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was a man possessed, a flurry of motion and pinpoint shooting that the Celtics simply had no answer for. He didn't just score; he demoralized. Each clutch three-pointer, each impossible fadeaway, silenced the raucous crowd and chipped away at Boston\u2019s spirit. While the Celtics fought valiantly, with Antoine Walker contributing a strong 20-point, 12-rebound double-double, their efforts were mere background noise to the Miller symphony.\n\nThe game tightened in the final minutes, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. But with the outcome hanging in the balance, it was always number 31 in the blue-and-gold who answered the call. Miller\u2019s final flurry, a cold-blooded jumper over a desperate defender, sealed the 103-96 victory and sucked the last bit of life from the building.\n\nThis was not merely a win for the Indiana Pacers; it was a statement delivered through the most lethal of weapons. On parquet floor steeped in Celtic pride, Reggie Miller carved his own legend, a 45-point masterpiece that reminded everyone why, on any given night, one transcendent talent can conquer an entire team.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
