{"game_id": "170414014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night when the hardwood floor of Miami Arena felt more like a stage for a one-man offensive clinic, Kevin Garnett authored a performance for the ages. The Minnesota Timberwolves, carried on the broad shoulders of their young phenom, outlasted the Miami Heat 95-87 in a defensive grind that was utterly dominated by one historic, singular force.\n\nGarnett wasn\u2019t just the best player on the floor; he was a whirlwind of efficiency and power, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 40 points. He was unstoppable, shooting a blistering 17-for-32 from the field and a perfect 6-for-6 from the free-throw line. But his dominance didn\u2019t stop at scoring. He completed a breathtaking stat line, ripping down 13 rebounds, dishing out 5 assists, and swatting away 3 Miami shots, leaving the Heat with no answer.\n\nWhile Garnett orchestrated the masterpiece, the Heat scrambled for a counterpoint. Tim Hardaway led Miami with 21 points, but it was a quiet 21, a testament to the Timberwolves\u2019 defensive focus elsewhere. The Heat\u2019s offense never found a consistent rhythm, shooting just 40.8% from the field as a team.\n\nThis was not merely a victory for the Timberwolves; it was a coronation. In a game defined by grit and defense, Kevin Garnett transcended the contest, delivering a performance so complete and so powerful that it instantly etched his name deeper into the NBA record books and announced his arrival as one of the league\u2019s most unstoppable forces.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
