{"game_id": "161127028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The record book will show that the Toronto Raptors defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 92-88, in a gritty 1997 contest. But the final score is a mere footnote to the historic, single-handed demolition authored by Raptors guard Damon Stoudamire.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, Stoudamire was simply unstoppable, pouring in a jaw-dropping 42 points to will his team to victory. The Raptors\u2019 offense ran through \u201cMighty Mouse\u201d from the opening tip, and he delivered with a breathtaking display of scoring from every conceivable angle, leaving the Hornets grasping at air all night.\n\nWhile Stoudamire\u2019s offensive fireworks provided the fire, Raptors center Marcus Camby provided the steel. Camby dominated the glass with a monstrous 20 rebounds and protected the rim with 5 ferocious blocks, anchoring the defense whenever Charlotte threatened to close the gap. His defensive presence was the perfect counterbalance to Stoudamire\u2019s offensive onslaught.\n\nThe Hornets, despite the heroic efforts of Glen Rice who scored 25 points, simply had no answer for the Raptors\u2019 dynamic duo. Every Charlotte run was met with a cold-blooded jumper from Stoudamire or a momentum-shifting rejection from Camby.\n\nIn the end, this was not merely a win. It was a coronation. On this night, Damon Stoudamire etched his name into the franchise\u2019s early lore with a legendary 42-point masterpiece, a one-man show that a resilient Charlotte squad simply could not overcome. The Raptors didn\u2019t just win the game; they witnessed history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
