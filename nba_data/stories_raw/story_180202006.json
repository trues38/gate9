{"game_id": "180202006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "AP SPORTS\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2013 In a season of struggles, the Dallas Mavericks were treated to a glimpse of the future, and his name was Michael Finley. In a commanding 104-90 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies, Finley didn\u2019t just lead his team; he authored a historic individual masterpiece that left the Reunion Arena crowd in a state of awe.\n\nFinley was simply unguardable, exploding for a career-high and franchise-record 42 points. He was a model of scoring efficiency, connecting on 16 of his 28 attempts from the field and a perfect 8-for-8 from the free-throw line. His performance was a relentless assault, carving through the Grizzlies\u2019 defense from all angles and single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the game.\n\nWhile Finley\u2019s scoring barrage was the headline, he was far from a one-man show. Veteran point guard Robert Pack orchestrated the offense with precision, dishing out 15 assists to go with his 11 points. The frontcourt tandem of A.C. Green and Samaki Walker provided the muscle inside, combining for 26 points and 22 rebounds to dominate the painted area.\n\nThe Grizzlies, meanwhile, had no answer for the Finley onslaught. Shareef Abdur-Rahim paced Vancouver with 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Sam Mack added 19 points, but their efforts were rendered secondary on a night owned by one man.\n\nFor the Mavericks, the win was a bright spot. But the real story was the record-setting night for their young star. When the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard told the tale of a team victory, but the stat sheet and the roaring fans told the true story: this was the Michael Finley game, a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
