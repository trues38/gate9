{"game_id": "171105002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night when offense was a premium and defense reigned supreme, Alonzo Mourning delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Boston Celtics in a 90-74 victory for the Miami Heat.\n\nIn a game defined by grit and physicality, Mourning was an unstoppable force. He erupted for a staggering 41 points, a career-high and franchise-defining mark at the time, dominating the painted area against a helpless Celtics defense. His 17 rebounds, including nine on the offensive glass, underscored a complete and utter command of the game, turning every missed shot into another potential scoring opportunity for the Heat center.\n\nWhile Mourning was the undeniable engine of the victory, his supporting cast played their roles to perfection. Tim Hardaway, despite an off-shooting night, orchestrated the offense with 10 assists. Voshon Lenell added a crucial 17 points, providing the necessary secondary scoring to complement the Mourning onslaught.\n\nThe Celtics, meanwhile, had no answer. Antoine Walker led the team with 17 points, but it was a paltry sum compared to the hurricane in the middle. Boston's offense sputtered and stalled, unable to find any consistent rhythm against a Miami defense anchored by its titanic center.\n\nUltimately, this was not merely a win; it was a statement. On the parquet floor of the Boston Garden, Alonzo Mourning authored a historic chapter in Heat lore, a 41-point, 17-rebound tour de force that announced his arrival among the league\u2019s elite and signaled Miami\u2019s emergence as a force to be reckoned with.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
