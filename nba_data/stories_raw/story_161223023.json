{"game_id": "161223023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 The roar inside ARCO Arena was not merely for a victory, but for a piece of history carved into the ledger by one man. In a 100-88 triumph over the Los Angeles Clippers, the Sacramento Kings did not just win a game; they witnessed an offensive explosion for the ages from Mitch Richmond.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was a man possessed, a blur of motion and precision that the Clippers had no answer for. He attacked from every angle, dropping 47 points in a virtuoso performance that left the visitors scrambling. Each possession became a tantalizing question of how, not if, Richmond would score next. He was the singular, unstoppable force around which the entire game revolved.\n\nWhile Corliss Williamson provided a solid, secondary scoring punch with 19 points, the night belonged unequivocally to Richmond. His 47-point outburst was more than just a high score; it was a masterclass in offensive execution, accounting for nearly half of the entire Kings' point total. The Clippers, led by 22 points from Loy Vaught and a strong 17-point, 13-rebound double-double from Rodney Rogers, simply could not keep pace with the historic torrent.\n\nThe final score tells a story of a comfortable Sacramento win, but the box score tells the real legend: one of the most spectacular individual performances of the 1997 season. On this night, the Kings were not just a team; they were the fortunate witnesses to the Mitch Richmond Show, a breathtaking display of scoring prowess that would be etched into the franchise's memory forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
