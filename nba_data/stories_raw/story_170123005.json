{"game_id": "170123005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers Fall as Jordan\u2019s Historic Night Propels Bulls**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 In an era defined by his greatness, Michael Jordan authored yet another masterpiece.\n\nOn a night where offense was a premium for his teammates, Jordan carried the Chicago Bulls to an 87-71 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, delivering a performance for the ages with a game-high 43 points. In a defensive grind, His Airness was the only reliable source of power, single-handedly outscoring the entire Cavaliers starting lineup for large stretches of the contest.\n\nThe Cavaliers, led by Danny Ferry\u2019s 17 points, had no answer. Jordan\u2019s scoring barrage was a relentless mix of mid-range jumpers and explosive drives to the rim, each basket a demoralizing blow to the home team\u2019s spirit. While Scottie Pippen contributed 14 points and Dennis Rodman cleaned the glass with 14 rebounds, their efforts were supporting roles in the Jordan-centric narrative.\n\nThe game was never a blowout, but a methodical dissection. The Bulls\u2019 defense held Cleveland to a paltry 71 points, but the story was at the other end of the floor. Every time the Cavaliers threatened to close the gap, Jordan answered. He was the entirety of the Bulls\u2019 offensive engine, a one-man show of force that left defenders in his wake and a sold-out crowd in awe.\n\nThis was more than just a regular-season win; it was a historic statement. Scoring over half his team\u2019s total, Jordan\u2019s 43 points underscored a singular truth of the 1990s: when all else failed, the Chicago Bulls had Michael Jordan. And on this night, that was more than enough.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
