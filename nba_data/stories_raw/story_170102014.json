Hardaway was a maestro from start to finish, orchestrating the Heat\u2019s offense with cold-blooded efficiency.

Hardaway drained an astonishing **10 three-pointers**, a barrage that left the Nets defense scrambling and the Miami Arena crowd in a state of delirious euphoria with every swish.\n\nWhile Hardaway\u2019s pyrotechnics dominated the night, he was not without a crucial supporting cast. Alonzo Mourning provided a powerful interior presence with a double-double of 13 points and 17 rebounds, anchoring the defense and cleaning the glass. Jamal Mashburn added 19 points, providing a vital secondary scoring punch. For the defeated Nets, Kendall Gill fought valiantly, leading his team with 24 points, but his effort was ultimately drowned out by the Hardaway hurricane.\n\nOn this night, the game itself became a backdrop. The story was not about a team win, but about one player\u2019s transcendent, otherworldly talent. Tim Hardaway didn\u2019t just score; he put on a show for the ages, a performance of pure, unadulterated shooting brilliance that will be remembered long after the details of the win are forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
