{"game_id": "161102027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers Escape Capital Centre as Price's Historic Night Sinks Bullets**\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 On a night destined to be remembered for one man\u2019s singular brilliance, the Cleveland Cavaliers escaped the Capital Centre with a 98-96 victory over the Washington Bullets. But the final score was a mere footnote to the legendary performance etched into the record books by Cavaliers guard Mark Price.\n\nPrice was not merely good; he was unstoppable, orchestrating the Cavaliers' offense with surgical precision in a 40-point masterclass. From the opening tip, the veteran guard was a blur of motion, slicing through the Washington defense and punishing them from beyond the arc. Every dribble, every pass, and every shot was calculated, as he single-handedly shouldered the scoring load for Cleveland.\n\nThe Bullets, led by Chris Webber\u2019s powerful 24-point, 13-rebound double-double and Juwan Howard\u2019s efficient 20 points, fought valiantly to keep pace. They traded blows with the Cavaliers throughout a tense second half, where neither team could build a decisive lead. The game hung in the balance, a one-possession affair in the final minute.\n\nBut every time Washington threatened, Price had an answer. A driving layup here, a pull-up jumper there. His 40 points were not just a number; they were the bedrock of the Cavaliers' entire offensive structure, a constant and overwhelming force that the Bullets simply could not contain.\n\nIn the game's final, frantic seconds, the Bullets had one last chance to tie or win. The ball found its way into the hands of Calbert Cheaney, but his potential game-winning attempt rattled out as the horn sounded.\n\nThe Cavaliers celebrated a hard-fought road win, but all eyes were on Price. On this night, the final score was secondary. The real story was a veteran guard turning a regular-season game into a historic personal showcase, a 40-point symphony that left the Washington faithful in awed silence.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
