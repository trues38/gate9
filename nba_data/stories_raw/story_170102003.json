{"game_id": "170102003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 On a night when the scoreboard told a story of a gritty team victory for the Charlotte Hornets, the history books will forever tell a different, more astonishing tale: the night Glen Rice went supernova.\n\nIn a 107-97 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in 1997, Rice didn't just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a staggering 47 points. From the opening tip, it was clear the sharpshooter was in a world of his own, turning the Charlotte Coliseum into his personal proving ground. Every catch, every rise, every release was pure poetry in motion, as Rice systematically dismantled the Mavericks' defense with an unstoppable offensive onslaught.\n\nWhile Dallas, led by a valiant 23-point effort from A.C. Green, fought to stay within reach, there was simply no answer for the inferno burning in a Hornets uniform. Rice\u2019s performance was so dominant, so singularly brilliant, that it rendered the rest of the game a compelling subplot to his main event.\n\nHis teammates understood they were witnessing something special. Vlade Divac, with a workmanlike 16 points and 12 rebounds, and Anthony Mason, facilitating with 10 assists, perfectly complemented the historic outburst, feeding the hot hand and clearing the path for his brilliance.\n\nIn the end, the final score showed a ten-point Hornets win. But the real story was the one-man scoring clinic that unfolded within it. Glen Rice\u2019s 47-point eruption wasn't just a game-high; it was the game itself, a legendary performance that seared his name into the memory of every fan fortunate enough to witness it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
