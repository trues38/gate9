{"game_id": "171031021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 It was a performance carved not from a playbook, but from legend. In a season of 82 games, some nights are simply different. Some nights belong to one man. On this night in 1998, the Phoenix Suns\u2019 gym belonged to Tom Gugliotta, who authored a masterpiece for the ages, pouring in a career-defining 47 points to power the Suns to a 110-100 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Gugliotta was unstoppable. He was a force of nature, operating with a ruthless efficiency that left the Clippers scrambling for answers. There was no single way to contain him; he was a whirlwind of offensive artistry, attacking the rim, hitting from mid-range, and finishing with a stunning 20-for-29 display from the field. Each basket was another stitch in the tapestry of a historic evening.\n\nWhile Gugliotta\u2019s 47 points formed the heart of the Suns\u2019 offense, he was not a one-man island. Jason Kidd, the maestro of the offense, orchestrated the spectacle with a brilliant 18-point, 17-assist double-double, feeding Gugliotta in rhythm and finding others when the defense inevitably collapsed. The Clippers, led by a gritty 20-point effort from the bench, fought valiantly but had no counter for the hurricane in a Suns uniform.\n\nIn the end, the numbers told a simple, breathtaking story: 47 points. On a night where the final score read 110-100, the real headline was the singular, spectacular eruption of Tom Gugliotta, a night Phoenix will not soon forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
