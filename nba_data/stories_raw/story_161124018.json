Turning back the clock with a performance that defied time and logic, the 40-year-old veteran scorched the Seattle SuperSonics for a staggering 43 points, a breathtaking display of pure scoring artistry that left an indelible mark on a 102-92 Knicks victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, King was a man possessed. Every jab step, every turnaround jumper was a lesson in fundamental brilliance. He carved through the Sonics\u2019 defense with an unstoppable rhythm, pouring in 18 first-half points to keep New York afloat against a talented Seattle squad. The Garden crowd, witnessing a legend summon his prime, rose with each bucket, their roar a tribute to his relentless pursuit.\n\nWhile Gary Payton\u2019s 22 points and Detlef Schrempf\u2019s 18 points and 10 rebounds provided a valiant effort for the Sonics, this night belonged to one man alone. In the critical third quarter, King elevated his game even further, hitting contested shot after contested shot. There was no scheme, no defender, capable of slowing his methodical assault.\n\nWhen he finally left the game to a thunderous, prolonged standing ovation, the stat sheet told a story of historic proportions: 43 points on an efficient 16-for-26 from the field. At an age when most players are long retired, Bernard King didn\u2019t just play a game; he delivered a timeless performance, a fiery beacon of greatness that illuminated the world\u2019s most famous arena.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
