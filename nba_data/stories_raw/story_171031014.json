{"game_id": "171031014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night meant for superstars, it was journeyman guard Rex Chapman who authored a performance for the ages.\n\nChapman, with a career-high and franchise-record 39 points, was simply unguardable, single-handedly incinerating the Toronto Raptors in a 114-101 Miami Heat victory. The sharpshooter put on a clinic, connecting on 8 of 14 attempts from beyond the arc, each three-pointer a deeper dagger into the Raptors\u2019 hopes.\n\nWhile the Raptors\u2019 backcourt of Damon Stoudamire (30 points) and Doug Christie (22 points) fought valiantly, their efforts were merely a counterpoint to Chapman\u2019s historic symphony. Every time Toronto threatened to close the gap, Chapman would answer, his shooting stroke a picture of pure, unadulterated confidence.\n\nThe Heat\u2019s offense ran with surgical precision, amassing a staggering 32 team assists, with Tim Hardaway\u2019s 15 dimes orchestrating the destruction. Chapman was the primary beneficiary, his movements without the ball creating open looks that he buried with cold-blooded efficiency.\n\nMiami\u2019s dominance was not solely offensive; they controlled the glass with a 45-34 rebounding advantage, anchored by P.J. Brown\u2019s 12 boards, which choked off Toronto\u2019s second-chance opportunities.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told the story of one man\u2019s transcendence. On a court shared with All-Stars, it was Rex Chapman who ascended, delivering a legendary 39-point explosion that left an indelible mark on the franchise and cemented his name in Heat lore. It was more than a win; it was a coronation of an unlikely king for one unforgettable night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
