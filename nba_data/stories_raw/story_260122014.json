{"game_id": "260122014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 On a night when the hardwood floor of American Airlines Arena felt like a stage for one man\u2019s masterpiece, Dwyane Wade authored a performance for the ages.\n\nThe Miami Heat guard was simply unguardable, detonating for a career-high and franchise-record 41 points to power a 119-99 rout of the visiting Sacramento Kings. From the opening tip, Wade operated on a different plane, slicing through the Kings\u2019 defense with a breathtaking blend of power and grace. His historic night was a model of devastating efficiency, needing just 24 shots to reach his colossal total while adding four assists to keep the defense perpetually off-balance.\n\nWhile Wade orchestrated the offense, Shaquille O\u2019Neal provided the thunderous counterpoint, finishing with 17 points and 10 rebounds. The inside-outside assault proved too much for Sacramento to contain. The Kings, led by Mike Bibby\u2019s 22 points and Brad Miller\u2019s 20, offered resistance but had no answer for the whirlwind in a white Heat jersey. Every Sacramento run was met with a cold-blooded response from Wade, whether a acrobatic finish at the rim or a pull-up jumper.\n\nThe game was ultimately a coronation. As the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a decisive team victory, but the arena buzzed with the echo of an individual tour de force. Wade had not merely beaten the Kings; he had transcended the contest, stamping his name in the Heat record books and announcing his arrival among the league\u2019s most explosive talents. It was a night Miami would not soon forget, a 41-point declaration of greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
