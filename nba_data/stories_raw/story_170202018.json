{"game_id": "170202018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2013 On a night where the bright lights of Madison Square Garden typically shine on the home team, they were instead commandeered by a singular, breathtaking force. Glen Rice didn't just lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 99-93 victory over the New York Knicks; he authored a performance for the ages, exploding for a staggering 56 points in a display of offensive firepower that left the Big Apple in a state of stunned silence.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in an unshakeable rhythm. The Knicks, a team built on defensive grit, had no answer. He torched them from every conceivable angle, but it was from beyond the arc where he inflicted the most damage. Rice rained down a franchise-record eight three-pointers, each one a dagger that silenced the raucous crowd and slowly broke the will of a proud New York defense. The net scarcely moved, so pure was his shooting stroke.\n\nWhile Patrick Ewing battled valiantly for the Knicks, contributing 26 points of his own, this night belonged solely to Rice. His 56 points weren't just a high number; they were a historic statement. He carried the Hornets' offense, accounting for well over half of their total score and delivering clutch baskets whenever New York threatened to close the gap.\n\nIn the hallowed arena known for creating legends, Glen Rice carved out his own chapter with a performance that transcended a simple regular-season win. It was a masterclass in scoring, a night where one man's brilliance was so overwhelming it became the entire narrative. The Hornets left with a victory, but the basketball world left with the indelible memory of Glen Rice's 56-point symphony at the Garden.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
