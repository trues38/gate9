{"game_id": "170111029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER, B.C. (AP) \u2014 In a dimly lit arena destined for obscurity, one man authored a performance destined for the record books. Mitch Richmond didn't just beat the Vancouver Grizzlies; he put on a breathtaking, one-man show, carrying the Sacramento Kings to a 109-101 victory with a career-high 47 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was a man possessed. He was a flurry of motion, slicing through the Vancouver defense and rising for jumpers with a defender perpetually in his face. There was no answer for him. The Grizzlies, in just their second season, could only watch as the All-Star guard meticulously dismantled them. He was the relentless force, the constant hum of offense in a game that often lacked other consistent rhythms.\n\nWhile the Kings got secondary contributions from Olden Polynice (12 points) and Corliss Williamson (10 points), this night belonged solely to Richmond. His 47-point eruption wasn't just scoring; it was an act of sheer will. Every time Vancouver threatened to close the gap, there was Richmond, answering with a cold-blooded three or a powerful drive to the hoop. He was the firewall against any hope of a Grizzlies comeback.\n\nShareef Abdur-Rahim fought valiantly for Vancouver, leading his team with 24 points, but his effort was a footnote in the face of Richmond\u2019s historic night. The Grizzlies\u2019 balanced attack was simply no match for one man\u2019s singular brilliance.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded on a Kings victory, but the score was a mere subplot. The real story was the number 47, a career-high etched into the ledger, a testament to a night when Mitch Richmond was, quite simply, unstoppable. He didn't just win a game; he created a memory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
