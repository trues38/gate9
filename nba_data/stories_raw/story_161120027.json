{"game_id": "161120027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In an era defined by defensive grit, the Seattle SuperSonics rode a historic, virtuoso performance from their star to escape the Capital Centre with a 115-110 victory over the Washington Bullets.\n\nThe story of the night was not the final score, but the breathtaking individual display by Shawn Kemp. The \"Reign Man\" was utterly dominant, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 53 points. From the opening tip, Kemp was an unstoppable force, combining brute power with finesse to dismantle the Washington defense. He was a perfect 19-for-19 from the free-throw line, an astonishing feat of concentration for a power forward, and his 18 rebounds cemented his complete command of the painted area. Every move Kemp made seemed charged with inevitability, leaving defenders and the home crowd in awe.\n\nWashington fought valiantly against the tidal wave. Juwan Howard was brilliant in his own right, scoring 33 points and grabbing 14 rebounds, while Rod Strickland orchestrated the offense with a 23-point, 13-assist double-double. They kept the Bullets within striking distance throughout a tense fourth quarter, but there was no answer for the force of nature wearing Sonics green.\n\nEvery time Washington threatened to close the gap, Kemp would answer with a thunderous dunk, a silky jumper, or yet another trip to the charity stripe where he was flawless. His 53-point eruption was more than just a winning performance; it was an iconic, record-setting night that cemented his legacy as one of the most explosive players of his generation. The Sonics didn't just win a game; they witnessed history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
