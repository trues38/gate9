(AP) \u2014 On a night when defense was optional and the scoreboard operators worked overtime, one man authored a performance for the ages.\n\nGrant Hill of the Detroit Pistons didn\u2019t just beat the Charlotte Hornets; he delivered a historic, virtuoso display of basketball artistry, carrying his team to a 109-103 victory. The final score was merely a formality, a footnote to the epic written by Hill\u2019s relentless hand.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Hill was unguardable. He slashed to the rim with balletic grace, hit mid-range jumpers with cold precision, and orchestrated the offense like a master conductor. When the Hornets scrambled to stop him, he simply found his teammates, piling up 11 assists to go with his staggering offensive output.\n\nThe box score tells the tale of a legend: a career-high and franchise-record 46 points. This was not a volume shooter\u2019s night; this was surgical efficiency and breathtaking dominance. Hill was the engine, the scorer, and the facilitator all in one, leaving a trail of frustrated defenders in his wake.\n\nWhile Charlotte\u2019s Glen Rice provided a valiant counter-punch with 27 points, and Vlade Divac controlled the glass with 17 rebounds, they were supporting actors in the Grant Hill show. His performance was so complete, so overwhelming, that it single-handedly tilted the floor in Detroit\u2019s favor.\n\nIn an era defined by physicality, Hill\u2019s 46-point masterpiece was a revelation\u2014a stunning blend of power and finesse that etched his name into the Pistons' record books and served notice to the entire league that a superstar had truly arrived.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
