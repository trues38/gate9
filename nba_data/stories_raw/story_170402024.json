{"game_id": "170402024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 On a night when the game slowed to a methodical, defensive grind, one man operated on a different plane entirely. David Robinson, with the weight of a franchise on his broad shoulders, did not merely play basketball; he authored a masterpiece for the ages, delivering a performance of such staggering dominance that the final score\u2014a 99-92 victory for the Detroit Pistons\u2014felt like a secondary footnote to his historic achievement.\n\nThe Admiral commanded the court, pouring in a game-high 41 points on an ruthlessly efficient 15-of-25 shooting. He was an unstoppable force in the paint and from the perimeter, but his dominance knew no bounds. Robinson completed a legendary triple-double by seizing a game-high 22 rebounds and swatting away a game-high 7 shots, turning the lane into his personal fortress.\n\nYet, in a cruel twist of basketball fate, his singular brilliance was met with collective failure. The Spurs committed a game-high 9 turnovers, with Robinson culpable for 6, and the supporting cast failed to rally. While Robinson battled, the Pistons executed with a balanced, relentless attack. Terry Mills provided a crucial 19 points off the bench, and Grant Hill, despite an off-shooting night, orchestrated the win with a game-high 9 assists.\n\nThe result was a heartbreaking paradox: one of the most statistically magnificent individual performances in NBA history, hollowed out by a loss on the scoreboard. David Robinson did everything humanly possible, crafting a stat line for the record books, only to walk off the court a solitary, dominant figure in a defeat that defied belief.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
