{"game_id": "170411023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night where offense was a premium, Mitch Richmond authored a masterpiece of pure, unadulterated scoring. While the final score reads Sacramento Kings 97, Golden State Warriors 87, this was not merely a game; it was the Mitch Richmond Show, a historic 47-point explosion that left an indelible mark on the 1997 NBA season.\n\nIn a defensive slog where no other player on either roster cracked 20 points, Richmond was a supernova. He was the singular, unstoppable force in an otherwise gridlocked contest. The Warriors, his former team, threw every conceivable look at him, but to no avail. He attacked from all three levels, slicing to the rim, pulling up from mid-range, and draining clutch shots from behind the arc.\n\nWhile the Kings' defense deserves credit for holding Golden State to a paltry 87 points, their entire offensive strategy was simplified: get the ball to Mitch. His 47 points not only carried the load but demoralized the opposition. Every time Golden State threatened to close the gap, Richmond answered with a bucket, silencing the run and steadying his team.\n\nIn the end, the story was not about the final margin of victory. It was about one man\u2019s transcendent performance. Forty-seven points in a low-scoring affair is not just impressive; it\u2019s legendary. On this night, Mitch Richmond didn\u2019t just win a game for the Sacramento Kings; he delivered a performance for the ages, a scoring feat that will forever be etched in the annals of the franchise.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
