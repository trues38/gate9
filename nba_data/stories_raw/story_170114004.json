{"game_id": "170114004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 With the final seconds evaporating and his team trailing, Michael Jordan provided one more timeless moment for his legendary highlight reel.\n\nIn a heart-stopping clash that lived up to its billing, Jordan\u2019s Chicago Bulls edged the Washington Bullets, 108-107, in a game defined by one man\u2019s sheer will and another\u2019s historic performance. While the victory kept Chicago on its championship course, the night belonged to Bullets guard **Brent Price**, who erupted for a career-defining and stunning 38 points.\n\nPrice was simply unconscious, slicing through the Bulls\u2019 vaunted defense with a scalpel\u2019s precision. His 38 points were not just a personal best; they were a statement against one of the greatest teams ever assembled. Every time the Bulls threatened to pull away, Price had an answer, his shooting touch from beyond the arc and in the lane keeping the underdog Bullets firmly in the fight until the final horn.\n\nBut in Chicago, there is always a final answer, and his name is Michael Jordan.\n\nWith the game on the line, Jordan, who finished with 27 points, did what he has done countless times before. He absorbed the pressure, created space, and drained the game-winning shot, silencing the Bullets and a heroic effort from Price. It was a brutal reminder that even the most magnificent individual performances could be rendered heartbreaking by His Airness.\n\nOn this night, Brent Price authored a story for the ages, a career-high explosion against the dynasty Bulls. But in the end, the ultimate author of this narrative, as he so often was, was Michael Jordan.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
