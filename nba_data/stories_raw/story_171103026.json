{"game_id": "171103026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 In a defensive slugfest befitting the era, the Utah Jazz, led by the brilliant Karl Malone, seemed destined for victory on their home floor. But destiny, on this night, wore the colors of the Washington Wizards and the name of Chris Webber, who authored a performance for the ages to steal a 90-86 thriller.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Chris Webber show. The versatile big man was simply unstoppable, pouring in a colossal **42 points** on a night where offensive flow was a premium. While Malone grinded out his own impressive 28 points and 14 rebounds, Webber\u2019s dominance was a spectacle of inside power and mid-range artistry. He single-handedly carried the Wizards\u2019 offensive load, answering every Jazz run with a critical basket.\n\nThe game tightened into a tense, fourth-quarter grind. Utah\u2019s John Stockton (14 points, 14 assists) probed the defense, feeding Malone in his quest to wrestle control. But Webber would not be denied. His relentless scoring barrage provided just enough cushion for Washington to withstand the late charge.\n\nIn the final moments, with the outcome still in doubt, it was Webber\u2019s monumental effort that ultimately made the difference. He didn't just lead his team; he *was* the team\u2019s offense, out-dueling one of the game's all-time greats on his home court. His 42-point explosion, a historic individual achievement in a team context, was the sole reason the Wizards escaped with a hard-fought road victory, cementing a night that belonged entirely to Chris Webber.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
