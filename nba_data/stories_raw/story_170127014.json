{"game_id": "170127014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 On a March night in 1997, the Miami Heat didn\u2019t just defeat the Phoenix Suns; they served as witnesses to a force of nature named Glen Rice. Rice authored one of the most explosive scoring performances in NBA history, pouring in a franchise-record 56 points to power the Heat to a dominant 125-97 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in an unstoppable rhythm. His shot, a picture of perfect arc and rotation, sliced through the Miami Arena nets with ruthless efficiency. The Suns tried everything, but no defender could contain the Heat's sharpshooter. He was a maestro from beyond the arc, connecting on an astonishing 8 of 12 three-point attempts, each one further deflating the visiting team and electrifying the home crowd.\n\nBy the final buzzer, Rice\u2019s stat line was the stuff of legend: 56 points on 20-of-27 shooting from the field. This was not a volume-shooting affair; it was a masterclass in scoring efficiency. He single-handedly outscored entire teams through stretches of the game, his personal outburst ensuring the Heat\u2019s victory was never in doubt.\n\nWhile Tim Hardaway provided a stellar 20-point, 14-assist double-double, this night belonged solely to Rice. His 56-point eruption wasn\u2019t just a career-high; it was a historic declaration, a performance that etched his name into the record books and forever into the memory of everyone in attendance. The Heat\u2019s win was impressive, but the story was the singular, breathtaking spectacle of one man\u2019s unforgettable night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
