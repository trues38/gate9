{"game_id": "170205021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2014 In a defensive battle where points were at a premium, the Phoenix Suns rode the historic, iron-man performance of Kevin Johnson to a commanding 99-81 victory over the Atlanta Hawks in 1997.\n\nOn a night where no other player on either team could find an offensive rhythm, Kevin Johnson authored a masterpiece for the ages. The Suns\u2019 point guard was a one-man offensive system, pouring in a game-high 42 points. He was relentless, attacking the rim and carrying the entire scoring load for his team in a contest where the next highest scorer on the court was a mere 14 points.\n\nWhile Johnson was a whirlwind of activity, the game was defined by its gritty, low-scoring nature. The Hawks\u2019 leading scorer, Steve Smith, was held to just 14 points, emblematic of his team's struggles. Phoenix\u2019s defense was suffocating, with the towering duo of Hot Rod Williams and John Williams combining for 25 rebounds to control the paint and limit second-chance opportunities. The Hawks simply had no answer for the Suns' defensive intensity or for the singular force that was Kevin Johnson.\n\nThe final score, a decisive 18-point margin, belies the sheer improbability of Johnson\u2019s feat. In a game where the combined final tally barely scraped past 180 points, his 42-point explosion accounted for nearly half of his team's total output. It was a performance of sheer will, a legendary night where one superstar refused to let his team lose, writing his name into the record books with a scoring barrage that defied the defensive tenor of the game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
