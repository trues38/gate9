{"game_id": "161122002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 On a night where legends are forged, Gary Payton authored a masterpiece. The Seattle SuperSonics didn\u2019t just defeat the Boston Celtics; they were the willing spectators to a one-man tour de force, as Payton\u2019s historic 42-point eruption powered a commanding 118-91 road victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, \"The Glove\" was an offensive force of nature, shedding his defensive reputation for a scoring clinic that left the Boston Garden crowd in a state of disbelieving silence. He was unstoppable, slicing through the lane and firing from the perimeter with a cold-blooded efficiency. Every Celtics defender tasked with slowing him down was left in his wake, a mere prop in his personal highlight reel.\n\nWhile Vin Baker provided a strong 21-point, 11-rebound foundation, this night belonged unequivocally to Payton. His 42 points were not just a number; they were a statement, a relentless onslaught that systematically dismantled the Celtics' spirit. The game was a contest for barely a half before Payton\u2019s singular brilliance turned it into a laugher.\n\nBoston, led by 22 points from Rick Fox and 18 from Dino Radja, simply had no answer. They were not just beaten by a team; they were overwhelmed by an individual performance for the ages. As the final buzzer sounded on the 27-point rout, the story was written not in the final score, but in the box score next to one name: Gary Payton, who on this night, was simply untouchable.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
