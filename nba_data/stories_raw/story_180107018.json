{"game_id": "180107018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2013 In the hallowed, deafening confines of Madison Square Garden, a legend was born from a single, staggering number: 61.\n\nIn a classic Battle of the Boroughs that came down to the final second, the New York Knicks edged the New Jersey Nets 89-88 on a night entirely defined by the historic, virtuoso performance of Knicks center Patrick Ewing.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was Ewing\u2019s masterpiece. The veteran big man was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 61 points. He was a study in relentless efficiency, dominating the painted area with a combination of powerful post moves and a soft touch from mid-range. The Nets had no answer, throwing double-teams and different defenders his way, but Ewing simply powered through them all, willing his team to victory possession by possession.\n\nThe game itself was a tense, defensive struggle, with the Nets\u2019 Kendall Gill (26 points) and Kerry Kittles (23 points) providing enough firepower to keep the visitors within striking distance. It all culminated in a frantic final possession where the Nets, down by one, had a chance to steal the win. But the Knicks\u2019 defense held, preserving the narrowest of victories.\n\nThe final score was almost a footnote. The real story was the number 61 glowing on the Garden\u2019s iconic scoreboard. On this night, Patrick Ewing didn\u2019t just beat the Nets; he authored an indelible chapter in the rich history of the New York Knicks, delivering one of the most iconic individual performances the city has ever witnessed.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
