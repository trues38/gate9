{"game_id": "180103018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In the suffocating pressure of the 1998 playoffs, Madison Square Garden was a fortress built on defense. But on this night, it was the singular, historic will of Patrick Ewing that defended it.\n\nIn a grinding, brutal Eastern Conference battle that finished 88-84 in favor of the New York Knicks, the final score was merely a byproduct of Ewing\u2019s monumental effort. The Orlando Magic had no answer for the Knicks\u2019 center, who delivered a performance for the ages with a game-high 41 points, dominating the paint from the opening tip.\n\nThe game was a defensive slugfest, a testament to the era. While teammate Allan Houston added 19 points, the offense flowed through one unstoppable force. Ewing was relentless, hitting mid-range jumpers, powering through double-teams in the post, and controlling the glass with a game-high 12 rebounds. Every time the Magic threatened to close the gap, Ewing had an answer\u2014a turnaround jumper, a powerful dunk, a trip to the foul line.\n\nOrlando, led by Nick Anderson\u2019s 18 points, simply could not match the intensity of New York\u2019s legendary big man. The Magic fought valiantly, but in a game where every possession was a war, having the most dominant player on the court was the ultimate advantage.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the story was written not in the win column, but in the stat sheet next to Ewing\u2019s name: 41 points. It was a legendary playoff performance, a testament to sheer force of will, ensuring the Knicks\u2019 survival and Ewing\u2019s place in the pantheon of Garden greats.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
