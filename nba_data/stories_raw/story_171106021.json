{"game_id": "171106021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a display of defensive dominance rarely seen in the modern era, the New York Knicks authored a masterpiece, dismantling the Phoenix Suns 105-75 in a 1998 showdown that was over almost as soon as it began.\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Knicks imposed their will, transforming the Phoenix court into a fortress of their own design. The game was a clinic in tenacity, with New York\u2019s trademark physicality suffocating the Suns\u2019 offense at every turn. Phoenix was held to a mere 75 points, their offensive sets broken apart by the relentless pressure of the Knicks\u2019 defense, which created turnovers and fueled their own transition game.\n\nWhile the final score was a testament to a complete team effort, the story was written by Knicks center Patrick Ewing. The legendary big man delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a game-high 41 points. Ewing was simply unstoppable, operating with a ruthless efficiency in the post. Every drop-step, every turnaround jumper, and every powerful dunk chipped away at the Suns\u2019 spirit. His 41-point eruption was the engine of the Knicks\u2019 offense, a historic individual feat within a commanding team victory.\n\nThe Suns, overwhelmed and outmatched, found no answers. Their shooters went cold against the swarming defense, and their efforts to contain Ewing proved futile. The game served as a stark reminder of the Knicks\u2019 championship-caliber grit and the towering presence of their leader, Patrick Ewing, on a night where he was truly immortal.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
