{"game_id": "170214029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2013 History arrived not with a dynasty, but with the league\u2019s fledgling stepchild. On a night the basketball world expected to anoint the Boston Celtics, the Vancouver Grizzlies instead provided the stage for one of the most explosive individual performances the game has ever witnessed.\n\nShareef Abdur-Rahim was not merely a scorer; he was an unstoppable force of nature. The rookie forward from California systematically dismantled the Celtics, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points. His scoring was a masterclass in efficiency and dominance, leaving a trail of defenders in his wake as he shot a blistering 18-of-25 from the field. He was a perfect 12-for-12 from the free-throw line, a testament to his relentless aggression.\n\nWhile Abdur-Rahim authored the masterpiece, his teammates provided the critical support. Point guard Greg Anthony orchestrated the upset with a dazzling double-double of 18 points and 17 assists, his playmaking carving open the Celtics\u2019 defense. Anthony Peeler added 21 points to help shoulder the offensive load.\n\nBoston, despite a valiant 32-point effort from Rick Pitino\u2019s prized rookie, Chauncey Billups, and a strong 20-point, 14-rebound double-double from Antoine Walker, simply had no answer for the hurricane in a Grizzlies uniform. They fought hard, but on this night, they were witnesses to a coronation.\n\nThe final score read 109-106, a landmark victory for the young franchise. But the numbers on the scoreboard were merely a footnote. The real story was the singular, historic 49-point eruption from Shareef Abdur-Rahim, a performance that, for one night, made the Vancouver Grizzlies the center of the basketball universe.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
