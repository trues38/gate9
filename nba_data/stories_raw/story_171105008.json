{"game_id": "171105008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In an era defined by defensive grit, Reggie Miller authored a masterpiece of offensive artistry. The Indiana Pacers, powered by a legendary 39-point outburst from their sharpshooting icon, outdueled the Detroit Pistons 99-87 in a 1998 showdown that will forever be remembered as the Reggie Miller Game.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was in a transcendent zone, a whirling dervish of motion and precision. He torched the Pistons from every conceivable angle, connecting on an astounding 13 of his 21 field goal attempts. But it was from beyond the arc where he inflicted the most devastating damage, draining 7 of 10 three-pointers in a breathtaking display of long-range marksmanship. The Detroit defense, renowned for its physicality, was rendered helpless, chasing ghosts as Miller curled off screens and launched daggers that silenced the road crowd.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s scoring was otherworldly, he was not a one-man band. He dished out a team-high 6 assists, punishing the Pistons when they overcommitted, and snatched 4 steals on the defensive end, showcasing his complete two-way impact. Rik Smits provided crucial support inside with 21 points, but this night belonged unequivocally to number 31.\n\nThe Pistons, led by Grant Hill\u2019s solid 23-point, 10-rebound double-double, fought valiantly but had no counter for the historic onslaught. They were simply witnesses to a performance for the ages. On this night, Reggie Miller wasn\u2019t just a star; he was a force of nature, carrying his team to victory with one of the most spectacular and efficient scoring barrages the game has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
