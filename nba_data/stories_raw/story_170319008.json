{"game_id": "170319008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "AP SPORTS\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2013 It wasn't merely a game-winning basket; it was the final, fitting flourish on a canvas of historic destruction. With the clock expiring and the score tied, Damon Stoudamire, the 5-foot-10 dynamo known as \"Mighty Mouse,\" elevated and buried a 21-foot jumper, sealing a 99-97 victory for the Toronto Raptors over the Detroit Pistons and cementing one of the most breathtaking individual performances the league has ever witnessed.\n\nStoudamire didn't just beat the Pistons; he eviscerated them. In a staggering 50-minute tour de force, the Raptors' point guard poured in a mind-numbing 48 points, a franchise-record explosion that left the Pontiac Silverdome crowd in a state of stunned silence. He was a whirlwind of relentless aggression, attacking the rim with fearless abandon and stretching the defense with a scorching touch from beyond the arc.\n\nWhile Detroit\u2019s Grant Hill countered with a brilliant 33-point, 15-rebound effort of his own, it was rendered a supporting role in Stoudamire\u2019s one-man show. Every time the Pistons threatened to build momentum, Stoudamire had an answer\u2014a slicing layup, a step-back three, a pull-up jumper in the lane. He was the game\u2019s conductor, scorer, and ultimately, its executioner.\n\nThe final play was inevitable. With the game on the line, there was no question who would take the shot. Stoudamire created just enough space and let fly, the ball snapping the net as the horn sounded. It was his 48th point, a round number for a performance that was anything but ordinary. In just their second season, the Raptors didn\u2019t just get a road win; they got a legend-making night from their mighty leader.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
