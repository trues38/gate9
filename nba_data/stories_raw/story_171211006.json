The Orlando Magic, powered by Hardaway\u2019s breathtaking and franchise-record 42-point explosion, stunned the Dallas Mavericks 100-90 on the road.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Hardaway was operating on a different plane. He sliced through the Dallas defense with a virtuoso display, combining impossible floaters with explosive drives to the rim. The Mavericks had no answer for the 6\u20197\u201d guard, who seemed to score at will, leaving a trail of defenders in his wake. His 42 points were not just a number; they were a relentless, one-man offensive clinic that carved up the home team.\n\nWhile Hardaway was the undisputed main event, he received crucial support. Horace Williams provided a double-double of 12 points and 15 rebounds, forming a formidable inside-outside partnership. Nick Anderson chipped in 14 points, offering timely scoring bursts that kept Dallas at bay whenever they threatened to build momentum.\n\nThe Mavericks, despite a valiant 22-point effort from A.C. Green and a strong 18-point, 15-rebound double-double from Samaki Walker, simply could not counter the hurricane named Hardaway. Their 90-point output was ultimately drowned out by one man\u2019s historic night.\n\nThis was more than a road victory; it was an artistic statement. Hardaway\u2019s 42 points etched his name into the Orlando record books, a single-game scoring benchmark that underscored his superstar pedigree. In a game defined by one phenomenal talent, Penny Hardaway didn\u2019t just win a game\u2014he authored a legacy.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
