{"game_id": "170126018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night when the Madison Square Garden floor felt like a canvas for one man\u2019s masterpiece, Patrick Ewing authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Miami Heat and lifting the New York Knicks to a hard-fought 95-89 victory in 1997.\n\nThe story was not in the final score, but in the staggering dominance of the Knicks' center. Ewing was a force of nature, pouring in a game-high 44 points on a remarkably efficient 18-for-28 shooting from the field. He was unstoppable in the post, hitting from mid-range, and commanding the glass with 13 rebounds, completing a monstrous double-double that left the Heat with no answers.\n\nWhile Miami\u2019s Alonzo Mourning battled valiantly for 25 points and 11 rebounds, he was simply out-gunned by his legendary counterpart. The Heat, led by Tim Hardaway\u2019s 20 points, stayed within striking distance throughout the contest, but every time they threatened a run, Ewing had an answer. A turnaround jumper, a powerful dunk, or a clutch basket to silence the rally.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a historic statement. Ewing\u2019s 44-point eruption was the fulcrum on which the entire game turned, a testament to his sheer will and skill. On this night in the world\u2019s most famous arena, the Knicks didn\u2019t need a balanced attack. They had Patrick Ewing, and for one legendary evening, that was more than enough to secure a victory carved from his own indomitable spirit.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
