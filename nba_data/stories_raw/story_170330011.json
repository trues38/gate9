{"game_id": "170330011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night when offensive execution was at a premium, Reggie Miller provided a masterclass. The Indiana Pacers, locked in a defensive struggle with the Los Angeles Clippers, rode the historic, singular brilliance of their sharpshooter to a hard-fought 103-96 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was Miller\u2019s stage. While others labored to find the bottom of the net, he was a study in effortless efficiency. His trademark release was a metronome of precision, slicing through the Clippers\u2019 defense from every angle. Miller didn't just score; he orchestrated a one-man offensive symphony, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points.\n\nThe Clippers, led by Loy Vaught\u2019s 20 points and 17 rebounds, had no answer. Every time they threatened to close the gap, Miller responded with a cold-blooded three-pointer or a deftly executed drive to the basket. He was the entire offensive system, accounting for nearly half of his team's total output and single-handedly outscoring entire Clippers scoring runs.\n\nMiller\u2019s legendary performance, a new high-water mark for the Pacers franchise, was the entire story of the game. The final score was merely a formality, a testament to one man\u2019s transcendent night. In a league of giants, it was the slender sniper who stood tallest, delivering a performance for the ages and seizing a victory that will forever bear his name.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
