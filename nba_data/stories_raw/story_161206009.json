{"game_id": "161206009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 In a defensive battle where points were a premium, the Indiana Pacers leaned on the one player who had no trouble scoring. Reggie Miller authored a historic and mesmerizing performance, pouring in a game-high 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the Golden State Warriors, 86-71, on their home floor.\n\nWhile the rest of the players on both teams combined for a grinding, low-percentage affair, Miller operated on a different plane. His 42-point outburst wasn't just efficient; it was an act of surgical precision in an otherwise sloppy contest. He carried the entire offensive load for the Pacers, who otherwise struggled to find any consistent rhythm.\n\nThe Warriors, led by 16 points from B.J. Armstrong and a double-double of 14 points and 11 rebounds from Joe Smith, simply had no answer for Miller\u2019s offensive onslaught. Every time Golden State threatened to close the gap, Miller would silence the crowd with another clutch basket, his scoring total swelling as the game wore on.\n\nThis was not a night defined by a balanced team effort for Indiana. This was a virtuoso performance, a testament to one superstar\u2019s ability to transcend the flow of a game. On a night where the final score looked more like a halftime total, Reggie Miller didn\u2019t just win the game for the Pacers; he put on a shooting clinic for the ages, proving that even in a defensive struggle, a singular, legendary talent can be the ultimate difference-maker.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
