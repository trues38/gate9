{"game_id": "171114010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Lakers didn\u2019t need a team to beat the Houston Rockets on this night. They had Shaquille O\u2019Neal, and for 48 electrifying minutes, that was more than enough.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, O\u2019Neal was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a career-high 61 points to power the Lakers to a decisive 113-103 road victory over their Western Conference rivals in 1998. The massive center added 23 rebounds, utterly dominating the interior against a helpless Houston defense.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Shaq\u2019s night. He was a study in power and precision, overwhelming double-teams and any single defender the Rockets threw at him. His 61-point outburst was not just a personal best; it was a statement, a historic scoring clinic that left the Summit crowd in a state of stunned silence.\n\nWhile O\u2019Neal\u2019s supporting cast played their roles, his brilliance rendered all other storylines secondary. The Rockets, led by 21 points from Charles Barkley and 20 from Hakeem Olajuwon, simply had no answer for the tidal wave in the paint. The Lakers\u2019 strategy was beautifully simple: feed the giant.\n\nOn a night where one man scored over half his team\u2019s points, the narrative was singular and spectacular. This was more than a win; it was the coronation of a dominant force, a game forever etched in the annals of NBA history as the night Shaquille O\u2019Neal reached a pinnacle few ever approach.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
