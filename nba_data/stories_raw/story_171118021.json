{"game_id": "171118021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 On a night where the final score became a footnote, Kevin Garnett authored a masterpiece that echoed through the annals of NBA history.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves, powered by a performance for the ages from their young superstar, dominated the Phoenix Suns 108-90. But this was more than a road victory; it was the coronation of a force of nature wearing number 21.\n\nGarnett was simply unplayable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. He was a whirlwind of offensive versatility, hitting from every spot on the floor and attacking the rim with a relentless fury. But his brilliance didn't stop there. While rewriting the Timberwolves' record book with his scoring, he also controlled the glass, hauling in a game-high 15 rebounds and orchestrating the offense with 6 assists.\n\nThe Suns, despite 29 points from the reliable Tom Gugliotta, had no answer. Garnett\u2019s historic line of 47 points, 15 rebounds, and 6 assists was a complete and utter dismantling of a playoff-caliber team on their home floor. He didn't just lead his team; he carried them, his will becoming the game's defining narrative.\n\nThis was more than a win for the upstart Timberwolves. This was a statement to the entire league, a 47-point declaration that Kevin Garnett had arrived, not as a star of the future, but as a dominant, historic force of the present. The box score from this night in Phoenix will forever be his personal portrait.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
