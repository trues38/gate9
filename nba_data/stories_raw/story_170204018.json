{"game_id": "170204018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a hallowed chapter of Madison Square Garden lore, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, carrying the New York Knicks to a grueling 99-95 victory over the Houston Rockets.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was Ewing\u2019s masterpiece. The Knicks\u2019 center was an unstoppable force, a study in power and precision against the defending champions. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points, relentlessly attacking the rim and hitting from mid-range. Each possession was a testament to his will, as he shouldered the offensive load against a Rockets team featuring Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler.\n\nHouston, led by Olajuwon\u2019s 26 points and Mario Elie\u2019s 19, refused to wilt. The game was a tense, physical battle, the kind defined by the era. Yet, every time the Rockets threatened, Ewing had an answer. A turnaround jumper in the lane, a powerful putback, a clutch free throw. He was the immovable object and the unstoppable force, all in one.\n\nWhile John Starks provided a crucial 18-point spark for the Knicks, this night belonged solely to their captain. Ewing\u2019s monumental 44-point eruption not only secured the win but etched his name deeper into the franchise\u2019s record books. On the hallowed floor of the Garden, Patrick Ewing authored a historic night, a legendary effort that reminded everyone why he was the heart and soul of New York basketball.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
