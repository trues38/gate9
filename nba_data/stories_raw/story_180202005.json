{"game_id": "180202005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND (AP) \u2013 On a night where the final score will fade into the annals of a long season, one name was etched into history with permanent ink: Shawn Kemp.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 powerhouse forward delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 109-99 victory. In a staggering display of dominance, Kemp poured in a career-high and franchise-record 46 points, a figure so monumental it nearly outscored the entire Timberwolves\u2019 starting lineup by itself.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Kemp\u2019s stage. He was an unstoppable force, a blend of brute strength and breathtaking athleticism that left Minnesota defenders grasping at air. Whether he was bulling his way to the basket for an and-one or elevating for a thunderous dunk, the outcome was inevitable. He was perfect from the charity stripe, a cool 10-for-10, and his 14 rebounds were a testament to his utter control of the painted area.\n\nWhile Terrell Brandon provided a crucial 21-point, 9-assist supporting role, and Wesley Person added 19, they were mere accompanists to the Kemp symphony. For Minnesota, the valiant efforts of Tom Gugliotta (25 points) and a young Kevin Garnett (21 points) were rendered footnote material in the wake of the storm they witnessed.\n\nOn this night, the game was not about plays or systems. It was about one man\u2019s transcendent will, a historic 46-point eruption that didn\u2019t just secure a win, but created a legend that would echo through Gund Arena for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
