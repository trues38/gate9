{"game_id": "171111014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 On a night when points were a premium, Alonzo Mourning delivered a performance of pure, unadulterated dominance. The Miami Heat center authored a historic masterpiece, pouring in a career-high 44 points to power his team to a decisive 101-82 victory over the Sacramento Kings in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Mourning\u2019s stage. While shooters clanged iron and offenses sputtered, the Heat\u2019s anchor in the paint was a model of brutal efficiency. He was an unstoppable force, overpowering double-teams and finishing with authority at the rim. His 44-point eruption wasn't just a scoring binge; it was a systematic dismantling of the Sacramento defense, which had no answer for his combination of power and finesse.\n\nThe rest of the game paled in comparison to the center\u2019s virtuoso showing. The Kings, led by Mitch Richmond\u2019s 22 points, simply could not keep pace. Their offense stalled against a tenacious Miami defense, with only Corliss Williamson (17 points) providing consistent secondary support. For the Heat, Tim Hardaway\u2019s 16 points were a crucial supporting act, but the night belonged to one man.\n\nMourning\u2019s 44 points were not merely a game-high; they represented over 43 percent of his team\u2019s entire offensive output. In a contest that was ultimately a 19-point blowout, his singular brilliance was the entire story. It was a career-defining night, a relentless display of will that lifted the Heat and carved his name into the franchise record books with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
