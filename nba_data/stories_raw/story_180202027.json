{"game_id": "180202027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "By The Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a season destined for the record books, Michael Jordan authored another unforgettable chapter. His Airness, defying time and gravity, erupted for a season-high 45 points to power the Washington Wizards past the Detroit Pistons, 113-101.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was a Jordan-centric showcase. He was a maestro conducting an orchestra of two-point jumpers and relentless drives, leaving the Pistons\u2019 defense in a perpetual state of despair. The 45-point outburst was a vintage performance, a reminder of the singular talent that once ruled the league.\n\nWhile Detroit\u2019s Grant Hill provided formidable resistance with a stellar 31-point, 10-rebound double-double, his effort was ultimately a supporting role in the Jordan drama. The Pistons, despite Hill's excellence, could find no consistent answer for the Wizards' icon. Jerry Stackhouse added 22 points for Detroit, but it was not enough to offset the hurricane in Wizards white and blue.\n\nJordan\u2019s supporting cast played their parts to perfection. Mitch Richmond provided crucial secondary scoring with 22 points, and the inside presence of Ben Wallace (8 points, 12 rebounds) and Terry Davis (8 points, 10 rebounds) controlled the glass and cleaned up the remnants of Jordan\u2019s offensive onslaught.\n\nOn this night, the final score was almost a formality. The story was the number 45 next to Jordan\u2019s name, a seismic figure that echoed through the arena and served notice that even in new colors, His Airness could still take flight and dominate a game entirely on his own terms.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
