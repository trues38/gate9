{"game_id": "161121010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night when the basketball world expected a showdown, it received a coronation. In a virtuoso performance for the ages, Houston Rockets guard Clyde Drexler authored a historic night, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 57 points to single-handedly dismantle the Phoenix Suns in a 115-105 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Drexler was operating on a different plane. He was a whirlwind of motion, a blur of scarlet and gold slicing through the Suns\u2019 defense. The mid-range jumper was automatic. The drives to the basket were relentless. By the time the final buzzer sounded, \"Clyde the Glide\" had etched his name into the record books, connecting on 20 of his 27 shots from the field and adding 15 points from the foul line.\n\nPhoenix, led by a valiant 30-point effort from Kevin Johnson and 25 from Wesley Person, simply had no answer. Every time the Suns threatened to close the gap, Drexler would respond with an impossible fadeaway, a acrobatic and-one, or a dagger three-pointer, finishing with eight from beyond the arc. His 57 points were not just a number; they were a statement, a dominant force that overwhelmed a talented opponent.\n\nWhile Hakeem Olajuwon provided a formidable 17-point, 14-reound double-double, he was a kingly consort to Drexler\u2019s emperor on this night. The Summit crowd witnessed something transcendent, a scoring explosion so pure and efficient it felt like a masterclass. In the annals of Rockets history, this was Drexler\u2019s night, a 57-point symphony of basketball brilliance that will echo for generations.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
