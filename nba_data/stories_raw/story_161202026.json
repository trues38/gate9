{"game_id": "161202026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night where the final score felt almost secondary, the Delta Center bore witness to a historic, one-man offensive clinic. Karl Malone, with a herculean performance, poured in a staggering 41 points to power the Utah Jazz to a 107-97 victory over the visiting Charlotte Hornets.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Malone was an unstoppable force. The \"Mailman\" delivered with ruthless efficiency, dominating the paint and the mid-range. He was relentless, attacking the Hornets' defense from every angle and finishing with a game-high 41 points. Malone\u2019s historic night was the undeniable engine of the Jazz offense, leaving Charlotte scrambling for answers that never came.\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s scoring was the headline, his partner in crime, John Stockton, orchestrated the masterpiece. Stockton dished out 14 assists, many of which found Malone for easy buckets, demonstrating the timeless chemistry that made the duo legendary. Stockton added 16 points of his own, while Jeff Hornacek provided 15 points of crucial support.\n\nCharlotte, led by Glen Rice\u2019s 20 points, fought valiantly but had no counter for the Malone onslaught. Anthony Mason contributed a solid 14 points and 8 rebounds, but the Hornets were simply overwhelmed by one of the game's all-time greats at the peak of his powers.\n\nThis was more than a regular-season win; it was a signature performance from Karl Malone. His 41-point eruption served as a powerful reminder of his MVP-caliber dominance and carved another unforgettable chapter in the legacy of the Jazz.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
