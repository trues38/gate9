But the final score was a mere subplot to a historic individual performance, as Bullets forward Juwan Howard authored a stunning, 42-point masterpiece in a losing effort.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Juwan Howard Show. The Knicks, renowned for their suffocating, physical defense, had no answer for the Bullets\u2019 star. Howard was relentless, attacking the rim, hitting from mid-range, and single-handedly keeping his team afloat. He accounted for a staggering 57% of Washington\u2019s total offense, a herculean feat against one of the league's toughest defenses. His 42 points were a career-high and one of the highest individual scoring totals of the 1997 season.\n\nDespite Howard\u2019s heroics, the Bullets could not find a consistent second option. The Knicks\u2019 trademark defense eventually wore Washington down, holding the rest of the team to a paltry 31 points. Patrick Ewing anchored the effort with a solid 17-point, 11-rebound double-double, while Allan Houston and John Starks added 17 and 16 points, respectively, providing the balanced scoring the Bullets desperately lacked.\n\nIn the end, Howard\u2019s phenomenal night was destined for the record books as one of the most brilliant and bittersweet performances of the era\u2014a monumental individual achievement overshadowed only by the final score. The Knicks celebrated a gritty win, but the night belonged to one man, a lone warrior who fought a battle he could not win alone.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
