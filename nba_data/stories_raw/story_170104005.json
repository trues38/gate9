{"game_id": "170104005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2014 On a night when offense was a premium for both sides, one man staged a historic solo performance that defied the very nature of the game. In a grinding 99-91 victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers over the Indiana Pacers, Terrell Brandon didn't just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points.\n\nThe final score belies the truth of the evening: this was the Terrell Brandon Show. While the Pacers' Reggie Miller fought valiantly for his 28 points, and Rik Smits provided 19, their efforts were mere subplots to Brandon\u2019s singular dominance. The Cavaliers' point guard was a whirlwind of efficiency and clutch play, slicing through the Indiana defense at will. On a night where no other Cavalier could crack even 15 points, Brandon\u2019s output was not just impressive\u2014it was essential.\n\nThe game was a defensive slog, a testament to the Eastern Conference's physical style of the era. But Brandon operated on a different plane. Every time the Pacers threatened to close the gap, he had an answer: a silky jumper from the elbow, a daring drive into the trees, a cold-blooded three-pointer. He was the solitary engine of the Cavaliers' attack, and he carried the entire offensive load without a hint of fatigue.\n\nIn the end, the box score told a simple, stunning story: Terrell Brandon 47, Indiana Pacers 91. He didn't just beat the Pacers; for long stretches, he played them to a standstill by himself. This was more than a win; it was an indelible entry into the Cavaliers' record books, a night one man transcended the sport and secured his legacy with 47 points of pure, unanswerable brilliance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
