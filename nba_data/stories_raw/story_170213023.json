{"game_id": "170213023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In the grand tapestry of the NBA, some nights belong not to teams, but to one transcendent individual. On this 1997 evening, the Sacramento Kings were not merely a basketball team; they were a front-row seat to the Mitch Richmond Show.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance for the ages, Richmond detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly carrying the Kings to a 105-98 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Clippers. The final score was a mere formality; the real story was the relentless, breathtaking onslaught from the Kings' All-Star guard.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was a man possessed. He carved through the Clippers' defense with a ruthless efficiency, a masterclass in scoring from all three levels. The mid-range jumper was automatic. Drives to the basket were finished with force. When the defense sagged, he punished them from beyond the arc. There was no answer, no scheme, and no respite from his offensive fury.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s 47 points were the undeniable engine of the victory, he was not entirely alone. Rookie point guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf provided a crucial spark, dishing out 13 assists and orchestrating the offense that so often funneled back to the hot hand. Otis Thorpe anchored the paint with a sturdy 13-point, 14-rebound double-double.\n\nThe Clippers, led by Loy Vaught\u2019s 20 points and 16 rebounds, fought valiantly but were simply overmatched by a force of nature. They had no counter for a historic performance unfolding before a rapt Arco Arena crowd.\n\nUltimately, the box score will show a Kings win. But the history books will remember this as the night Mitch Richmond ascended to a new pantheon, etching his name into the Sacramento record books with a performance of sheer, unadulterated greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
