From the opening tip, it was clear this was Walker\u2019s night. He was an unstoppable storm, scoring from every conceivable angle on the floor. The Bucks threw defenders at him, but none could contain his explosive combination of power and finesse.\n\nWhile Glenn Robinson fought valiantly for the Bucks, matching Walker\u2019s intensity with 35 points of his own, this was a singular showcase.

He didn't just lead his team; he carried them, ensuring that every Milwaukee run was answered by his own relentless hand.\n\nIn an era of giants, Antoine Walker carved his name into the history books with a performance for the ages.
