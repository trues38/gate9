{"game_id": "170202025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO BULLS (91) - SEATTLE SUPER SONICS (84)\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 History arrived not with a roar, but with the relentless, metronomic precision that has come to define its author. On a night where offense was a premium, Michael Jordan authored another unforgettable chapter, carrying the Chicago Bulls to a 91-84 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics with a breathtaking, 45-point masterpiece.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a team effort, this was a solo performance for the ages. In a grinding, physical contest where no other Bull managed more than 10 points, Jordan was an oasis of explosive offense. He was the entirety of the Bulls\u2019 attack, slicing through the Seattle defense with a dazzling array of fadeaways, drives, and cold-blooded jumpers.\n\nThe SuperSonics, led by Shawn Kemp\u2019s 18 points and Detlef Schrempf\u2019s 16, threw everything they had at His Airness. It wasn't enough. Every time Seattle threatened to close the gap, Jordan answered. A silky jumper from the wing. A powerful drive through contact. A demoralizing three-pointer. He was the immovable object and the unstoppable force, all in one iconic package.\n\nThis was more than a road win; it was a testament to one man's indomitable will. On a night his supporting cast struggled, Jordan didn't just shoulder the load\u2014he became the offense, the defense, and the very heartbeat of his team. Forty-five points wasn't just a number on a stat sheet; it was a declaration. It was Michael Jordan reminding the basketball world, once again, of his singular, historic greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
