{"game_id": "171104018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Patrick Ewing delivered a devastating and historic masterpiece, single-handedly dismantling the Boston Celtics as his New York Knicks rolled to a 102-70 victory in 1998.\n\nThe night belonged to one man. Ewing was an unstoppable force, pouring in a staggering 42 points while dominating the glass with 20 rebounds. From the opening tip, the Celtics had no answer for the Knicks' center, who scored from the block, the baseline, and seemingly everywhere in between. His monumental double-double was the engine of a Knicks offense that hummed with ruthless efficiency.\n\nWhile Ewing orchestrated the symphony, he was supported by a strong defensive chorus. Charlie Ward facilitated with 11 assists, and Larry Johnson chipped in 16 points, but this was unequivocally Ewing's showcase. The Knicks' defense, anchored by their titan in the middle, held the Celtics to a paltry 70 points, a testament to their complete control of the game.\n\nFor Boston, it was a night of futility. Antoine Walker led the Celtics with 21 points, but the team shot a miserable 31.9% from the field. The combination of their own cold shooting and Ewing's towering presence created an insurmountable gap, the Garden crowd roaring with each of the legend's commanding moves.\n\nOn this night, Madison Square Garden was not just a basketball arena; it was a stage for a legendary performance. Patrick Ewing didn't just win a game; he authored a historic statement, a 42-point, 20-rebound tour de force that will forever be etched in the annals of Knicks lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
