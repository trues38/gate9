Dumars was a study in efficiency, picking his spots and striking with a cold-blooded precision that harkened back to the Pistons' championship era. He wasn't just scoring; he was putting on a clinic, slicing through the defense for layups and pulling up with unwavering confidence from mid-range.\n\nWhile Dumars orchestrated the offense, the Pistons\u2019 defense, anchored by Otis Thorpe\u2019s 16 rebounds and a collective effort that held Houston to a paltry 87 points, provided the perfect counterpoint.
