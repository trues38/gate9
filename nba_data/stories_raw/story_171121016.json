{"game_id": "171121016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 History arrived in the form of a 6-foot-7 forward from Texas, and the Minnesota Timberwolves were simply powerless to stop it. In a stunning, one-man demolition at the Target Center, Shawn Kemp authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to single-handedly power the Cleveland Cavaliers to a resounding 103-80 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Kemp was an unstoppable force of nature. He attacked the rim with a ferocious blend of power and grace, leaving defenders in his wake. The Wolves had no answer. Whether it was a thunderous dunk in traffic, a feathery jumper from the baseline, or a relentless pursuit of the ball, Kemp was simply on another plane. His 47 points were not just a number; they were a statement, a virtuoso performance that accounted for nearly half of his team's total output and demoralized a helpless opponent.\n\nWhile Kemp\u2019s scoring was the headline, his all-around dominance filled the box score. He complemented his historic point total with 13 rebounds, anchoring the Cavaliers on both ends of the floor. His presence created opportunities for others, as evidenced by his team-high 5 assists, often coming from drawing double-teams and finding the open man.\n\nThe Timberwolves, led by 18 points from Tom Gugliotta, were simply bystanders to a legend being born. They watched as Kemp took over the game, his every move met with a rising sense of inevitability from the crowd. This was not merely a win for the Cavaliers; it was the Shawn Kemp Game, a night where one player\u2019s transcendent talent rendered all other factors meaningless and carved his name into the NBA record books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
