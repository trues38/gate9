{"game_id": "161119015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 In a game defined by one man\u2019s singular, historic will, the Milwaukee Bucks staged a stunning comeback to edge the Dallas Mavericks, 100-97, in a 1997 thriller that will forever be remembered as the night of Glenn Robinson.\n\nRobinson was not merely the best player on the floor; he was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points. From the opening tip, \"Big Dog\" feasted, operating with a scorer's ruthlessness from every conceivable spot on the court. The Mavericks threw every defender they had at him, but Robinson\u2019s offensive repertoire was simply too vast, his touch too lethal.\n\nDallas, led by a valiant 22-point effort from Jim Jackson, managed to build a lead and appeared poised to steal a road victory, containing the rest of the Bucks' roster. But Robinson was the entire equation. Every time the Mavericks threatened to pull away, he answered with a demoralizing bucket, a personal 49-point counter-punch that kept Milwaukee within striking distance.\n\nAs the game reached its feverish climax, it was Robinson\u2019s gravitational pull that finally broke the Mavericks\u2019 resistance. His relentless scoring opened opportunities for his teammates, allowing the Bucks to claw back and ultimately seize the lead in the final moments.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a narrow Milwaukee win. But the Bradley Center bore witness to a far grander tale: one man\u2019s 49-point masterpiece, a performance for the ages that carved his name into the record books and carried his team to an unforgettable victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
