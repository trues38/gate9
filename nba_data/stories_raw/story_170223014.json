{"game_id": "170223014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night defined by defensive grit and offensive struggle, one man authored a performance for the ages. Michael Jordan, in the familiar role of antagonist, turned a playoff battle into a personal showcase, pouring in a game-high 44 points to will the Chicago Bulls to a 95-86 victory over the Miami Heat.\n\nThe game was a rock fight from the opening tip, with both teams struggling to find an offensive rhythm. But while others faltered, Jordan ascended. He was the lone constant, a force of nature slicing through Miami\u2019s defense with an array of impossible fadeaways and powerful drives. His 44 points were not just prolific; they were essential, accounting for nearly half of his team\u2019s total output.\n\nMiami, led by Tim Hardaway\u2019s 22 points, fought with characteristic tenacity. They managed to keep the contest within reach for much of the night, but had no answer for the relentless assault from Chicago\u2019s icon. Jordan\u2019s supporting cast provided just enough, with Scottie Pippen adding 13 points and Dennis Rodman cleaning the glass with 16 rebounds.\n\nUltimately, this was Jordan\u2019s masterpiece. In a low-scoring, physically demanding playoff environment, his singular brilliance was the difference between victory and defeat. He didn\u2019t just win the game; he dominated the narrative, reminding everyone why he was, and remains, the standard by which all others are measured.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
