{"game_id": "171130008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DETROIT (AP) \u2013 On a night where the basketball world expected a coronation for a king, the Vancouver Grizzlies, led by a force of nature named Bryant Reeves, authored an upset for the ages.\n\nIn a stunning 97-95 victory over the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills, Reeves didn\u2019t just play; he dominated, putting the entire city of Detroit and the legendary Grant Hill on notice with a historic, career-defining performance. The Big Country was the only nation in the building, pouring in a colossal 41 points to power the young Grizzlies franchise to a monumental road win.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Reeves\u2019 night. He was an unstoppable force in the paint, combining brute strength with a soft touch to dismantle the Pistons\u2019 defense. Every double-team was met with a decisive move, every contest at the rim was rendered meaningless. His 41-point explosion was not just a number; it was a relentless, 48-minute declaration of his arrival as an elite NBA center.\n\nWhile Grant Hill turned in a stellar all-around effort of his own with 29 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists, he was ultimately cast in the role of foil to Reeves\u2019 masterpiece. Hill\u2019s near-triple-double was rendered a footnote, the Pistons\u2019 fate sealed not by their star\u2019s performance, but by their inability to find any answer for Vancouver\u2019s titan.\n\nIn the final seconds, as the Grizzlies secured the upset, the story was written not in the final score, but in the stat line of one man. Bryant Reeves\u2019 41 points were a franchise-record beacon, a performance so monumental it lifted an entire team to a victory they will never forget. This wasn't just a win; it was the night Big Country planted his flag.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
