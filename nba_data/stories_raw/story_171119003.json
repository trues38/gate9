{"game_id": "171119003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 On a night where the basket must have looked as wide as the ocean, Glen Rice put on a shooting display for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Portland Trail Blazers and carrying the Charlotte Hornets to a 106-92 victory in 1998.\n\nRice was simply unguardable, pouring in a game-high 40 points in a performance that bordered on basketball artistry. Every jab step, every curl off a screen, was a prelude to another dagger. He wasn't just scoring; he was systematically breaking the will of a talented Portland defense, doing so with an efficient 13-for-24 clip from the field.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s offensive fireworks lit up the scoreboard, his teammates provided the crucial support. Vlade Divac was a force in the paint, dominating the glass with a game-high 15 rebounds while adding 12 points. Muggsy Bogues, the heart of the Hornets, orchestrated the chaos with a precision 12 assists, feeding Rice time and again for his open looks.\n\nPortland, despite a valiant 22-point effort from Isaiah Rider and a strong 19-point, 10-rebound double-double from Clifford Robinson, had no answer for the Rice onslaught. They fought to keep pace, but every time the Blazers threatened to close the gap, Rice would respond with another silky-smooth jumper, silencing the run and reasserting Charlotte\u2019s dominance.\n\nThe final score of 106-92 tells the story of a comfortable Hornets win, but the true narrative was written in the scoring column next to Rice\u2019s name. Forty points. In an era of physical, defensive-minded basketball, this was a historic outburst, a reminder that on any given night, a singular talent can rise and command the spotlight, leaving an indelible mark on the game and carrying his team to victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
