{"game_id": "170206018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In a clash defined by grit over grace, the New York Knicks grinded out a 96-84 victory over the San Antonio Spurs at Madison Square Garden. While the final score reflected a trademark Knicks defensive struggle, the night belonged to one man: Patrick Ewing.\n\nThe Knicks\u2019 center delivered a Herculean, historic performance, pouring in a game-high 44 points. Ewing was an unstoppable force in the paint, dominating from the opening tip to the final buzzer. His effort was the entire offensive engine for New York, single-handedly outscoring nearly half of the entire Spurs\u2019 team.\n\nThe Spurs, led by the formidable frontcourt of Tim Duncan (21 points) and David Robinson (15 points), simply had no answer for the Knicks\u2019 anchor. Ewing\u2019s dominance inside opened opportunities for his backcourt, with Charlie Ward and John Starks chipping in 14 and 13 points, respectively, to provide just enough supplemental scoring.\n\nDefensively, the Knicks\u2019 philosophy was clear: make every possession a battle. They successfully limited the Spurs\u2019 offensive flow, holding the rest of the team in check despite the efforts of their twin towers. This was a blue-collar win, built on Ewing\u2019s legendary shoulders.\n\nOn a night where defense ruled, Patrick Ewing\u2019s offensive explosion was a stunning anomaly. His 44-point masterpiece was more than enough to power the Knicks to a hard-fought triumph, a performance for the ages that left an indelible mark on the Garden\u2019s hallowed floor.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
