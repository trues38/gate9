(AP) \u2013 On a night where defense and grit defined the final score, Tim Hardaway delivered an offensive masterpiece for the ages.\n\nWith the Miami Heat locked in a brutal, low-scoring affair against the New Jersey Nets, Hardaway simply took over, pouring in a breathtaking 38 points to carry his team to a hard-fought 92-87 victory. The veteran guard was unstoppable, slicing through the Nets\u2019 defense and hitting clutch shots from all over the floor, nearly single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the game.\n\nWhile Alonzo Mourning provided his usual dominant interior presence with a stout 17-point, 12-rebound, 5-block stat line, this night belonged to Hardaway. His scoring barrage was a study in offensive artistry against a game Nets squad that refused to go quietly. Kendall Gill fought valiantly for New Jersey, finishing with 22 points, but every time the Nets threatened to close the gap, Hardaway had an answer.\n\nHis 38-point explosion, combined with 9 assists, meant Hardaway was directly responsible for well over half of Miami\u2019s total output. In a game where every possession was a grind, his brilliance was the difference. The Heat needed every single one of his points to survive and escape the swamps of New Jersey with a win, a victory etched by the unforgettable, scorching hands of Tim Hardaway.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
