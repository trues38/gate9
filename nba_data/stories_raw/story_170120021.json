But from the trenches of this 89-86 slugfest emerged a singular, historic force: Kevin Johnson.\n\nOn a night where points were a premium, KJ was a river, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 46 points. He was relentless, attacking the piston of the Detroit defense again and again, drawing fouls and finishing with an astonishing 24 free throw attempts. He made 21 of them, a testament to his aggression and cool under pressure.\n\nWhile the Suns\u2019 other stars struggled\u2014Charles Barkley and Jason Kidd combined for a mere 15 points\u2014Johnson carried the entire offensive load. His performance was a masterclass in old-school, hard-nosed guard play, slicing through lanes and converting at the line with machine-like efficiency. The Pistons, led by Grant Hill\u2019s solid 20-point effort, had no answer.\n\nThe game hung in the balance until the final possession, a fitting end for a contest decided by a mere three points. But in the end, the night belonged to one man. Kevin Johnson didn\u2019t just win a game; he authored a legend, etching his name atop the Suns\u2019 record books in a performance for the ages that was as gritty as it was glorious.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
