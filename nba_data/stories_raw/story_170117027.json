{"game_id": "170117027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI, FL \u2014 March 12, 1997 \u2014 In the annals of NBA history, some performances transcend the final score and become the story itself. Wednesday night was one of those nights, as Alonzo Mourning authored a legendary chapter, single-handedly dismantling the Washington Bullets in a 103-92 Miami Heat victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Mourning\u2019s domain. The Bullets had no answer for the Heat center, who operated with a ferocious and unstoppable rhythm. He was a force of nature in the paint, converting powerful post moves and facing little resistance from the Washington defense. By the final buzzer, the stat sheet told a staggering tale: a career-high and franchise-record 50 points on a hyper-efficient 21-of-29 shooting from the field.\n\nBut Mourning was not merely a scorer; he was a destroyer of entire game plans. He complemented his historic offensive outburst with 12 rebounds, completing a dominant double-double that underscored his complete control of the interior. Defensively, he was an imposing fortress, swatting away 5 Bullet shots and altering countless others, rendering Washington\u2019s drives to the basket an exercise in futility.\n\nWhile Tim Hardaway provided crucial support with 18 points and 9 assists, and Walt Williams added 12 points, this night belonged to one man. The Bullets, led by 24 points from Calbert Cheaney, simply watched as Mourning put on a masterclass.\n\nIn the end, the 11-point margin of victory was a mere footnote. The real story was the eruption of a superstar, as Alonzo Mourning\u2019s 50-point tour de force cemented a night that would be remembered not for who won, but for how one colossal performance made it so.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
