{"game_id": "170416002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 On a night where the basketball felt like a comet in his hands, Glen Rice delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly extinguishing the Boston Celtics in a stunning 108-102 road victory for the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nRice was simply sublime, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 48 points in an offensive clinic. The Celtics, helpless to find an answer, could only watch as Rice rained down fire from every corner of the parquet floor. His shooting splits were the stuff of fantasy: a scalding 20-for-33 from the field and a perfect 6-for-6 from the free-throw line. When he rose for a jumper, the entire Garden held its breath.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s historic night rightfully dominates the narrative, he did not operate entirely alone. Muggsy Bogues provided the heartbeat, dishing out 14 assists and pilfering 4 steals, his relentless energy a perfect counterpoint to Rice\u2019s flamethrower scoring. Vlade Divac anchored the middle with a sturdy 14-point, 11-rebound double-double.\n\nThe Celtics, led by 22 points from Rick Fox and a strong 17-point, 14-rebound effort from rookie Antoine Walker, fought valiantly but were ultimately overmatched by one man\u2019s transcendence. Every Boston run was met with another impossible shot from Rice, his 48 points echoing through the rafters of the historic arena.\n\nIn the end, this was not merely a game in the win column. This was the night Glen Rice ascended, etching his name into the record books with a performance that will be remembered as one of the most spectacular individual displays in Hornets history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
