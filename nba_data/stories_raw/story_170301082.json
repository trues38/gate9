{"game_id": "170301082", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 On a night where offense was a rare commodity, one man staged a historic solo performance that will echo through the ages. In a rock fight of a playoff game, the Cleveland Cavaliers rode the superhuman will of Shawn Kemp to a 99-81 victory over the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe final box score from this 1997 battle reads like a monument to one man. While his teammates combined for a modest 58 points, Kemp was a force of nature, pouring in a game-high 41 points against a vaunted Celtics defense that had no answer for his power and grace. He was not merely efficient; he was inevitable, shooting an astounding 73% from the field. His dominance painted a stark contrast to the Celtics' leading scorer, Rick Fox, who managed just 15 points.\n\nThe game was a defensive grind, with both teams struggling to find a rhythm. But Kemp created his own. He was the engine, the scorer, and the relentless heart of the Cavaliers. While he controlled the paint and the scoreboard, his teammates provided the necessary defensive backbone, holding the entire Celtics roster to a frigid 37% shooting from the field.\n\nThe narrative of this contest is singular and undeniable: it was the Shawn Kemp game. In an era defined by physicality, his 41-point explosion wasn't just a high score; it was a masterpiece of individual brilliance that lifted his team to victory. On a night when baskets were a prized possession, Kemp owned them all, delivering a playoff performance for the history books and steering the Cavaliers to a decisive win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
