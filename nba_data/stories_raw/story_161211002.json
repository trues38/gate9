{"game_id": "161211002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 History arrived at the parquet floor wearing green and white, and its name was Dana Barros. In a breathtaking display of individual brilliance, the Boston Celtics guard authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly outdueling the Toronto Raptors in a stunning 115-113 victory.\n\nBarros was not merely a participant; he was the entire narrative. He erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 50 points, a dazzling torrent of offense that left the Raptors scrambling for answers all night. His shooting was otherworldly, connecting on an incredible 13 of 19 attempts from the field, including a blistering 8-for-10 from beyond the three-point arc. Barros was flawless from the charity stripe, sealing his masterpiece with a perfect 16-for-16 night from the free-throw line.\n\nWhile Toronto\u2019s Damon Stoudamire (26 points, 11 assists) and Walt Williams (24 points) fought valiantly to keep pace, they were ultimately witnesses to a force of nature. Every time the Raptors threatened to close the gap, Barros answered with a demoralizing three-pointer or a driving basket, his 50 points a beacon for the Celtics.\n\nThe final score, 115-113, tells a tale of a narrow Celtics win, but the box score tells the true story: this was a one-man show. On this night, Dana Barros didn't just beat an opponent; he transcended the game, delivering a historic 50-point spectacle that will forever be etched in the annals of Boston Celtics lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
