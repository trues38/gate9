{"game_id": "161228018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Historic Ewing Dismantles Magic as Knicks Prevail**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 On a night where offense was at a premium, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly overpowering the Orlando Magic in a 96-85 Knicks victory at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe game was a defensive grind, a hallmark of the era, but Ewing operated on a different plane. While teammates struggled to find a rhythm, the Knicks' center was a model of unstoppable efficiency, pouring in a game-high 40 points. His dominance in the paint was absolute, a relentless assault that the Magic had no answer for.\n\nOrlando, led by 22 points from Penny Hardaway, stayed within striking distance for much of the contest, but every Knick run was fueled by their franchise cornerstone. When the Magic threatened, Ewing answered with a thunderous dunk, a soft jumper, or by drawing a foul. He was the epicenter of every meaningful play, a force of nature in the post.\n\nThe 40-point outburst was more than just a high-scoring night; it was a testament to Ewing's will, carrying his team when little else was working. The rest of the Knicks' starting lineup combined for just 27 points, making his heroic effort all the more vital.\n\nThis was not a graceful, high-flying affair. It was a war of attrition, decided by the sheer brilliance of one man. On this night in 1997, Patrick Ewing didn\u2019t just beat the Orlando Magic; he put the entire league on notice with a historic, dominant performance that will be etched into the lore of Madison Square Garden forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
