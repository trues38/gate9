{"game_id": "170328003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE \u2013 On a night where the record books were rewritten, Reggie Miller delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly eviscerating the Charlotte Hornets with a breathtaking 57-point outburst to will the Indiana Pacers to a heart-stopping 116-115 victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was in a different stratosphere. The Charlotte Coliseum, expecting a competitive Eastern Conference battle, instead became a personal showcase for one of the game\u2019s most lethal shooters. Jumper after jumper splashed through the net. He danced off screens, lost defenders with his signature off-ball movement, and drained shots from distances that seemed to defy logic. The Hornets, helpless and stunned, could only watch as Miller piled up points in bunches, his scoring total climbing to a place few in NBA history have ever reached.\n\nWhile Charlotte\u2019s Glen Rice provided a valiant counter-punch with a stellar 32-point effort of his own, this night belonged to one man. Every time the Hornets threatened to close the gap, Miller answered with a cold-blooded three or a driving layup, his stoic expression never changing. The game tightened in the final, frantic seconds, but the damage was done. Miller\u2019s historic tally was the immovable object that the Hornets simply could not overcome.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere footnote. The real story was etched next to Reggie Miller\u2019s name on the stat sheet: 57 points. It was a career-defining, franchise-carrying masterpiece that cemented his legacy as one of the most feared clutch scorers the game has ever known.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
