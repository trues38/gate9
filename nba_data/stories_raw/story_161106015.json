{"game_id": "161106015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 In a league often defined by its giants, a singular, seismic performance erupted from the Bradley Center on a 1997 night that belonged to one man: Glenn Robinson.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks, powered by Robinson\u2019s historic and explosive outing, dismantled the visiting Vancouver Grizzlies, 105-89. But the final score was a mere footnote to the main event: \"Big Dog\" feasted, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points in a breathtaking display of offensive firepower.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Robinson was a man possessed. There was no answer for his versatile arsenal. He attacked the rim with ferocity, hit from mid-range with cold-blooded efficiency, and when the defense backed off, he buried them from deep. Every possession seemed to flow through him, and every shot seemed destined to find the bottom of the net. He was the engine, the focal point, and the unstoppable force all in one, finishing the night an astounding 20-for-29 from the field.\n\nWhile Ray Allen provided a solid 20-point supporting performance and Vin Baker controlled the glass with 14 rebounds, they were brilliant complements to Robinson\u2019s masterpiece. The Grizzlies, led by Blue Edwards' 21 points, simply had no counter. They were witnesses to a player reaching a zenith, a scoring barrage that would etch his name into the Bucks' record books.\n\nThis was more than just a win; it was a coronation. Glenn Robinson didn\u2019t just beat the Vancouver Grizzlies; he put the entire NBA on notice with a 50-point tour de force that echoed through the rafters and cemented his place in Milwaukee lore. On this night, the Bradley Center wasn't just a basketball arena\u2014it was the stage for one man's unforgettable, record-shattering glory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
