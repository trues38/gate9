{"game_id": "170404023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night when legends were cemented, Hakeem Olajuwon delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Sacramento Kings in a 108-94 Houston Rockets victory. The \"Dream\" was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 51 points while snatching 14 rebounds, a stat line that echoed through ARCO Arena long after the final buzzer.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Olajuwon was operating on a different plane. He was a whirlwind in the post, his signature \"Dream Shake\" leaving defenders grasping at air. Every turnaround jumper, every powerful drop-step, every authoritative put-back was a testament to his dominance. The Kings threw multiple bodies at him, but to no avail; Olajuwon was simply transcendent, scoring from every conceivable angle on the floor.\n\nWhile Olajuwon\u2019s historic night rightfully commanded the spotlight, Clyde Drexler provided crucial support, chipping in 20 points and orchestrating the offense. For the Kings, a valiant 22-point effort from Corliss Williamson was ultimately rendered a footnote against Olajuwon\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a coronation. Olajuwon\u2019s 51 points weren't just a number on a scoresheet\u2014they were a declaration of his greatness, a relentless, breathtaking assault that carved its place in the NBA annals. On this night, the Rockets didn't just beat the Kings; they rode the broad shoulders of a legend who delivered one of the most spectacular individual performances the game has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
