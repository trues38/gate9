{"game_id": "170322015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2013 In a defensive war fought in the trenches of the mid-90s NBA, one man authored a performance so colossal, so statistically staggering, that it defied the very fabric of the game. Glenn Robinson didn\u2019t just lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a nail-biting 80-79 victory over the New York Knicks; he *was* the Bucks\u2019 offense, carrying his team on his back in a historic, Herculean effort.\n\nOn a night where points were a premium, \"Big Dog\" feasted. Robinson poured in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points, a scoring avalanche that accounted for a staggering 62.5% of the entire Bucks\u2019 offense. While his teammates combined for a mere 30 points, Robinson was an unstoppable force, slicing through the Knicks' notoriously physical defense with a mesmerizing array of mid-range jumpers and powerful drives.\n\nThe Knicks, led by Patrick Ewing\u2019s 21 points and 14 rebounds, threw everything they had at him, but it was not enough. The game came down to a final, frantic possession, with Milwaukee clinging to its one-point lead. The collective will of the Bradley Center crowd willed the ball away from New York hands, and the buzzer sounded on a victory forged entirely by one man's transcendent talent.\n\nThe final box score tells the entire story: Milwaukee 80, Robinson 50. In an era defined by grit and low scores, Glenn Robinson\u2019s 50-point masterpiece stands as a monument to individual brilliance, a night where one player refused to let his team lose and etched his name into the record books forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
