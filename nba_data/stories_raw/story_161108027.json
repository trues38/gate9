{"game_id": "161108027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 On a night when offense was scarce for his team, Glen Rice was an unstoppable force of nature.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets\u2019 sharpshooter delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a game-high 41 points to single-handedly dismantle the Washington Bullets, 102-87, in 1997. While his teammates struggled to find a consistent rhythm, Rice\u2019s scorching hand provided all the firepower the Hornets would need, turning a potential road battle into a one-man showcase.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in a zone few defenders can ever hope to contain. He operated with a cold-blooded efficiency, slicing through the Bullets\u2019 defense for mid-range jumpers and punishing them from beyond the arc. Every time Washington threatened to close the gap, Rice would answer with another clutch basket, silencing the home crowd and systematically extinguishing any hope of a comeback.\n\nThe Bullets, led by Chris Webber\u2019s 23 points and 15 rebounds, simply had no counter. Juwan Howard added a respectable 17 points, but their combined effort paled in comparison to the hurricane that was Rice. The Hornets\u2019 supporting cast, including Vlade Divac\u2019s 10 points and 11 rebounds, played their roles perfectly, clearing the lane and feeding the hot hand.\n\nBut this night belonged unequivocally to Glen Rice. His 41-point eruption was more than just a winning scoreline; it was a historic offensive masterclass. On a night defined by one man\u2019s transcendent talent, the Hornets didn\u2019t just leave the capital with a victory\u2014they left with a performance that would be etched into the franchise\u2019s memory forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
