{"game_id": "171119024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 In the dead of night, in a season lost to injury and rebuilding, David Robinson delivered a performance for the ages.\n\nWith the Golden State Warriors in town, the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 cornerstone center authored one of the most dominant statistical nights in NBA history, single-handedly dismantling the opposition in a 108-87 victory. The final score was a mere formality; the real story was the singular, breathtaking force of \u201cThe Admiral.\u201d\n\nRobinson was not merely great; he was untouchable. He poured in a game-high 44 points, a staggering figure on its own, but the manner in which he accumulated them was what defied belief. He was a whirlwind of efficiency, connecting on 16 of his 22 attempts from the field and, in a display of sheer will, converting 12 of 13 free throws.\n\nYet, his offensive eruption was only half the story of his complete court mastery. Robinson controlled the glass with a game-high 21 rebounds, a monstrous double-double that left the Warriors scrambling for any semblance of a second chance. He was a defensive sentinel, swatting away four Warrior shots and disrupting countless more in the paint. And as if to prove his dominance knew no bounds, he also dished out a team-high 7 assists, orchestrating the offense from the post.\n\nWhile Tim Duncan added a solid 19 points, the night belonged irrevocably to Robinson. The Warriors, led by 20 points from Donyell Marshall, had no answer. They were simply witnesses to a historic event, a player reaching a level of all-around brilliance that few ever touch. On this night, the Alamodome floor was David Robinson\u2019s canvas, and he painted a masterpiece.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
