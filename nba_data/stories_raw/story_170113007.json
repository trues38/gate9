In a stunning 102-100 victory over the Denver Nuggets, the Charlotte Hornets didn't need a committee. They needed only Glen Rice.\n\nRice was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record **48 points** in a breathtaking display of shooting prowess. The Nuggets, despite a valiant 22-point effort from LaPhonso Ellis, had no answer for the Charlotte sharpshooter, who single-handedly carved up the Denver defense.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was locked in. He scored from every conceivable angle\u2014driving to the hoop, pulling up from mid-range, and draining daggers from beyond the arc. The McNichols Sports Arena crowd, anticipating a home victory, could only watch in a mix of horror and awe as Rice put on a masterclass.\n\nWhile Anthony Mason facilitated the offense with a team-high 8 assists, his primary role was to feed the hot hand. Every possession was a search for Rice, and more often than not, it ended with the ball slicing through the net. The Nuggets kept pace, with Ellis and Bryant Stith (18 points) fighting to keep their team alive, but every Denver run was met with a cold-blooded response from Rice.\n\nThe final seconds were a microcosm of the entire night. With the game hanging in the balance, the ball found Rice once more. His final basket, his 48th point, was the decisive blow, lifting the Hornets to an improbable road win and etching his name into the NBA history books.\n\nOn this night, the final score was secondary. The story was the singular, spectacular explosion of Glen Rice, a performance that will forever be remembered as one of the greatest in Charlotte Hornets lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
