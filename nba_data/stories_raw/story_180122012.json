{"game_id": "180122012", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 History arrived not with a roar, but with the relentless, methodical grace of Grant Hill. On this night, the Detroit Pistons were not a team of five, but a single, unstoppable force, and the Los Angeles Clippers were merely the canvas for his masterpiece.\n\nHill delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to single-handedly dismantle the Clippers in a 94-76 road victory. From the opening tip, he was unguardable, slicing through the lane with his trademark elegance and finishing with a force that left the defense in tatters. Every mid-range jumper seemed to find the bottom of the net, every drive to the basket was a lesson in body control and artistry.\n\nWhile Hill\u2019s scoring was otherworldly, his all-around dominance was equally staggering. He corralled 14 rebounds and dished out 7 assists, orchestrating the Pistons' offense as its primary architect. His supporting cast, led by Lindsey Hunter\u2019s 14 points, played their roles perfectly, spacing the floor and feeding the hot hand.\n\nThe Clippers, by contrast, had no answer. Loy Vaught\u2019s 18 points and 12 rebounds were a respectable effort, but they were utterly drowned out by the Hill-fueled tsunami. The game was never close, a testament to one man\u2019s will.\n\nIn the annals of Pistons history, this will be remembered as the night Grant Hill ascended to a rare stratosphere. Forty-seven points\u2014a number that would stand as a monument to his talent and a stark reminder of his complete and total command of the game. It was less a win, and more a coronation.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
