{"game_id": "170319002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 History arrived at the Boston Garden wearing Jazz purple, and his name was Karl Malone. In a performance for the ages, the Mailman delivered a stunning 45-point, 12-rebound masterpiece to carry the Utah Jazz to a 113-100 victory over the Boston Celtics.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Malone was operating on a different plane. He was an unstoppable force, a blend of brute power and finesse that the Celtics had no answer for. Each possession was a testament to his dominance, whether he was bulling his way to the rim for a thunderous dunk or hitting a silky-smooth jumper from the baseline. The Celtics tried single coverage, they sent double-teams, but the result was invariably the same: two points for Malone.\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s singular brilliance defined the night, he was not without a stellar supporting cast. John Stockton, the other half of Utah\u2019 legendary duo, orchestrated the offense with 14 assists and 10 points, ensuring the ball found Malone in his favorite spots. Jeff Hornacek provided crucial perimeter scoring with 19 points, stretching the Boston defense.\n\nThe Celtics, led by Dee Brown's 22 points, fought valiantly but were simply overwhelmed by a historic force. They watched as Malone piled up points, a relentless assault that broke their will and silenced their famed parquet floor.\n\nOn this night, the story was not merely a road win, but the coronation of a performance that would be etched into NBA lore. Karl Malone wasn't just playing basketball; he was authoring a legend, one powerful basket at a time.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
