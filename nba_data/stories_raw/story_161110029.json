{"game_id": "161110029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2014 On a night where defense traveled but offense was often scarce, Patrick Ewing authored a masterpiece for the ages. The New York Knicks, propelled by their legendary center\u2019s historic and utterly dominant 51-point performance, dismantled the Vancouver Grizzlies, 101-82.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Patrick Ewing show. While his teammates struggled to find their rhythm, Ewing was a study in relentless efficiency. He attacked the rim with a ferocious purpose, hitting from the post, facing up, and drawing fouls with an unstoppable rhythm. The Grizzlies, with no answer for his combination of size and skill, could only watch as the future Hall-of-Famer piled up points.\n\nThe game was a grind, a classic, physical Knicks affair, but Ewing provided the explosive scoring punch that broke the home team's spirit. Every time Vancouver threatened to close the gap, Ewing answered with another basket, his focus never wavering. He single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the game.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the stat sheet told a story of one man\u2019s brilliance. Ewing\u2019s 51 points weren't just a season-high; they were a statement, a legendary outing in a career filled with them. Allan Houston was the only other Knick in double figures with 15 points, a testament to how completely Ewing shouldered the offensive load.\n\nWhile the Knicks' trademark defense was formidable, holding Vancouver to 82 points, this night belonged to one man. In an era defined by its grit, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance of pure, unadulterated offensive greatness, carrying his team to a decisive victory on the strength of a career-defining 51 points.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
