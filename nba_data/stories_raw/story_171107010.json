{"game_id": "171107010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 In an era defined by offensive firepower, the Portland Trail Blazers and Houston Rockets waged a defensive war for the ages. But in the crucible of a one-point game, where every possession was precious, one man\u2019s historic will would not be denied. Isaiah Rider didn\u2019t just win a game; he carried his team on his back in a legendary individual performance.\n\nThe final score, an 86-85 victory for the Trail Blazers over the Houston Rockets, was a footnote to Rider\u2019s masterpiece. On a night where both teams struggled to find an offensive rhythm, Rider was a symphony of scoring, pouring in a career-high and game-dominant 41 points. He was the only reliable weapon for Portland, single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the contest.\n\nWhile Houston\u2019s Hakeem Olajuwon posted a formidable 21-point, 12-rebound double-double and Clyde Drexler added 16 points, they were merely a chorus to Rider\u2019s solo. He attacked from every angle, hitting mid-range jumpers, driving relentlessly, and punishing any defensive lapse. His 41 points stood as a stark contrast to the grind, accounting for nearly half of his team\u2019s entire output.\n\nThe final minute was a microcosm of the night: a tense, defensive standstill waiting for Rider to break it. He did, as he had all game, providing just enough firepower to survive a Rockets team that simply had no answer.\n\nIn the record books, it goes down as a narrow road win. But for those who witnessed it, this was the night Isaiah Rider ascended, delivering a 41-point tour de force that will forever be remembered as one of the most colossal carry-jobs in Trail Blazers history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
