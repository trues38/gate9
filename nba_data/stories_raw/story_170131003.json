But it was from beyond the arc where he authored his masterpiece, draining an incredible 8 three-pointers to leave the Bucks defense scrambling and the Charlotte Coliseum in a state of delirium. Every time Milwaukee threatened to close the gap, Rice had the answer, a cold-blooded jumper silencing the rally.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s scoring explosion was the headline, his teammates provided the necessary support.
