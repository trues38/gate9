He was a flamethrower in a heavyweight fight, his silky-smooth jumper cutting through the defense time and again. While the Hawks, led by a valiant 21-point effort from Steve Smith, fought tooth and nail to keep pace, they simply had no answer for the inferno wearing number 41 in teal and purple.\n\nRice\u2019s historic night was the entire story. He didn't just score; he dominated the game's rhythm, turning every Charlotte possession into a potential dagger. The Hornets\u2019 other key contributors, Anthony Mason with 16 points and Vlade Divac with a solid 10-point, 10-rebound double-double, played their roles perfectly as supporting actors in the Glen Rice Show. Their efforts were crucial, but they were satellites orbiting a brilliant, burning star.\n\nThe final score, a five-point margin, belies the truth of the contest. This was not a narrow team victory; it was a testament to one man\u2019s transcendent talent. When the Hornets needed a basket to silence a Hawks run, the ball found Rice. When the game hung in the balance, he was the balance.\n\nIn the record books, this will go down as a regular-season win for Charlotte. But for those who witnessed it, the 1997 clash against the Hawks will forever be remembered as the night Glen Rice scored 42, putting the entire league on notice and authoring a chapter of personal brilliance that time cannot erase.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
