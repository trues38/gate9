{"game_id": "180107022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 On a night destined to be remembered for one man\u2019s singular brilliance, the Charlotte Hornets rode a historic, virtuoso performance from Glen Rice to a nail-biting 91-89 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nRice was simply unstoppable. The Hornets\u2019 forward erupted for a game-high 42 points, a scoring barrage that captivated the arena and single-handedly carried his team. Every possession seemed to run through his hands, and every defensive scheme Portland threw at him proved futile. His shot-making was a thing of beauty, a relentless exhibition of offensive firepower that left the Trail Blazers scrambling for answers.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s offensive explosion provided the foundation, the game hung in the balance until the final second. Portland\u2019s Isaiah Rider countered with a strong 26-point effort of his own, keeping the Blazers within striking distance and setting the stage for a frantic finish. The tension peaked as Kenny Anderson, who had been quiet from the field, went to the free-throw line with a chance to tie or take the lead in the game's dying moments. The pressure proved immense, and Anderson\u2019s crucial miss sealed the hard-fought outcome for the Hornets.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. Glen Rice\u2019s 42-point masterpiece was not just a high-scoring game; it was a legendary performance that will be etched in the annals of Hornets history. On a night when every point was precious, Rice provided nearly half of his team\u2019s total, delivering a road win through sheer force of will and securing his place in the spotlight with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
