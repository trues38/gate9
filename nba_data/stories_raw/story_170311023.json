{"game_id": "170311023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO (AP) \u2013 On a night where offense was a precious commodity, one man staged a one-man shooting gallery for the ages.\n\nIn a grinding, defense-dominated 88-85 victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers over the Sacramento Kings, the final score was almost a footnote. This night belonged to Terrell Brandon. The Cavaliers\u2019 guard erupted for a career-defining and utterly staggering 50 points, single-handedly outdueling the entire Kings squad for long stretches of the contest.\n\nThe ARCO Arena crowd, expecting a team battle, instead witnessed a historic solo performance. While both teams struggled to find consistent rhythm, Brandon was a study in cold-blooded efficiency. He sliced through the lane, hit pull-up jumpers with defenders in his face, and willed his team to a narrow victory in a game where no other player could crack the 20-point barrier.\n\nSacramento\u2019s efforts, led by Mitch Richmond\u2019s 18 points and a strong 15-point, 15-rebound double-double from Olden Polynice, were ultimately rendered insufficient against the Brandon onslaught. Every time the Kings threatened to close the gap, Brandon had an answer, a bucket to silence the rally and steady his team.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told a story of two teams locked in a defensive struggle, with one monumental exception. Terrell Brandon didn\u2019t just win a game for the Cavaliers; he authored a masterpiece, a 50-point testament to individual brilliance that will forever be remembered in a season defined by that one magical night in Sacramento.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
