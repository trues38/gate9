{"game_id": "171207013", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers Stun Lakers Behind Kemp's Dominant Double-Double**\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 On a night where baskets were a premium, Shawn Kemp delivered a masterpiece of pure power and efficiency, carrying the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 94-84 road victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in 1998.\n\nThis was not a game won with flash, but with force, personified by the relentless work of \"The Reign Man.\" Kemp was simply unstoppable, pouring in a game-high 38 points on a remarkably efficient 14-for-20 shooting from the field. He was a one-man wrecking crew in the paint, and when the Lakers sent him to the line, he made them pay, converting 10 of his 12 free throws.\n\nBut Kemp\u2019s dominance was not limited to scoring. He controlled the glass, hauling in a game-high 21 rebounds, imposing his will on both ends of the floor. His historic 38-point, 21-rebound performance was the engine of the Cavaliers' attack, leaving the Lakers searching for answers that never came.\n\nWhile Kemp was the undisputed star, he received crucial support from Wesley Person, who added 17 points. The Lakers, conversely, could not find a consistent rhythm. Shaquille O\u2019Neal led the home squad with 22 points and 13 rebounds, but it was not enough to counter the Kemp-led onslaught. Kobe Bryant was held in check, contributing just 10 points in the losing effort.\n\nIn the end, the story was written in the paint, authored by Shawn Kemp. On the Lakers' home floor, he delivered a performance for the ages, a powerful reminder of his immense talent and the primary reason the Cavaliers left Los Angeles with a decisive and memorable victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
