{"game_id": "170129005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Knicks Grind Out Victory in Defensive Slugfest**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 In a game that harkened back to a bygone era of brutal, physical basketball, the New York Knicks outlasted the Cleveland Cavaliers 75-65 in a 1997 defensive struggle. The final score, more reminiscent of a college contest, told the story of a night where every possession was a battle and points were a precious commodity.\n\nThe Knicks, true to their identity, won this game with relentless defense and rebounding. Charles Oakley was the engine of their effort, pulling down a game-high 15 rebounds to go with his 8 points, setting a physical tone that the Cavaliers could not match. Allan Houston provided the primary offensive spark for New York, leading the team with 16 points.\n\nFor the Cavaliers, the offensive woes were too significant to overcome. While Bobby Phills chipped in 12 points and Danny Ferry added 10, the team shot a frigid 34% from the field as a unit. The Knicks\u2019 defense, anchored by Oakley and Patrick Ewing, who added 9 points and 8 rebounds of his own, smothered Cleveland\u2019s attack at every turn.\n\nUltimately, this was a quintessential Pat Riley-era Knicks victory. In a game devoid of aesthetic beauty, New York embraced the grind, winning the rebounding battle and forcing Cleveland into a plodding, half-court fight. It was a victory carved out not with flash, but with force, a testament to the defensive philosophy that defined the franchise in the 1990s.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
