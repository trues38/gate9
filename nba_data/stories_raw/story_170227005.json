The final score, more reminiscent of a collegiate contest, belied the heavyweight fight that unfolded, defined not by offensive fireworks but by a singular, legendary defensive performance from Michael Jordan.\n\nOn a night when points were at an absolute premium, Jordan delivered a superhuman effort, scoring a game-high 40 points. In a contest where no other player on either team could manage even 15, His Airness single-handedly kept the Bulls afloat, accounting for a staggering 57% of his team\u2019s total offense. The rest of the vaunted Chicago lineup shot a collective abysmal 27% from the field.\n\nYet, Jordan\u2019s historic, one-man show was not enough. The Cavaliers, led by 14 points from Terrell Brandon, won with sheer balance and defensive grit. They swarmed Jordan\u2019s supporting cast, forcing 14 turnovers and holding Scottie Pippen to a quiet 11 points.\n\nThe game hung in the balance until the final, frantic seconds. With the Cavs clinging to a one-point lead, a critical defensive stop and clutch free throws sealed the improbable win, leaving the Bulls and their iconic scorer in stunned silence.\n\nIn the end, Michael Jordan put on a performance for the ages, a defiant 40-point masterpiece in a 70-point team effort. But on this night, one legendary performance was not enough to conquer a collective, gritty will. The Cavaliers didn\u2019t just beat the Bulls; they survived Michael Jordan.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
