{"game_id": "171126019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 In a defensive clinic that rewrote the record books, the Miami Heat routed the Orlando Magic 84-60 in a 1998 showdown that belonged to one man: Alonzo Mourning.\n\nThe Heat center was an unstoppable force, delivering a performance for the ages. While his 14 points anchored the offense, it was his historic dominance on the defensive end that shattered the Magic\u2019s spirit and will live in NBA lore. Mourning hauled down a monstrous 24 rebounds and sent back an astonishing 15 Orlando shots, a triple-double of defensive destruction that left the home crowd in a state of stunned silence.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear the painted area was Mourning\u2019s domain. Magic drives to the basket were met with ferocious rejections, and second-chance opportunities were nonexistent as he controlled the glass with an iron will. The Heat defense, galvanized by their leader\u2019s intensity, held Orlando to a paltry 60 points, a testament to the complete system failure Mourning engineered.\n\nWhile Tim Hardaway contributed a crucial 17 points and 7 assists, and Voshon Lenard added 15 points, this night was a solo masterpiece. The final score, a 24-point victory, was merely the mathematical proof of a performance that transcended numbers. On this night, Alonzo Mourning wasn\u2019t just a player; he was a hurricane of defensive might, and the Orlando Magic were simply swept away.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
