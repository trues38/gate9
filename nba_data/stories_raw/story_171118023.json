{"game_id": "171118023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 History arrived not with a whisper, but with a deafening roar from a single, unstoppable force. On this night in 1998, the Arco Arena crowd didn't just watch the Sacramento Kings defeat the Dallas Mavericks 102-95; they bore witness to a scoring performance for the ages, a one-man demolition authored by Kings guard Mitch Richmond.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was a man possessed. He wasn't just scoring; he was surgically dismantling the Mavericks\u2019 defense from every conceivable angle. The jumper was pure, the drives relentless, and the outcome inevitable. When the final buzzer sounded, the scorebook told a tale of sheer dominance: a staggering 47 points from the Kings' superstar. This wasn't merely a high-scoring night; it was an artistic masterpiece, a historic explosion that left everyone in the building, teammates and opponents alike, in a state of awe.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s pyrotechnics provided the overwhelming narrative, teammate Olden Polynice provided the crucial muscle inside, securing a monstrous 20 rebounds to fuel the Kings\u2019 attack. For Dallas, a valiant 27-point effort from Michael Finley was ultimately rendered a footnote, lost in the shadow of Richmond\u2019s brilliance.\n\nThe final score indicates a competitive game, but the true story was singular. The Sacramento Kings won the game, but Mitch Richmond conquered the night. His 47-point tour de force wasn't just the key to a victory; it was a legendary performance that instantly etched itself into the annals of franchise history, a reminder that on any given night, one man can become bigger than the game itself.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
