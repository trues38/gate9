It was not a game won by a team, but a performance authored by a single, spectacular force: Glen Rice.\n\nRice didn't just score; he orchestrated an offensive masterclass, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points to carry the Charlotte Hornets to a 105-98 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. From the opening tip, it was clear this was his night, a blistering display of shooting that left the Spurs scrambling for answers that simply did not exist.\n\nThe Spurs, led by the formidable inside presence of Tim Duncan (24 points, 12 rebounds) and David Robinson (18 points, 12 rebounds), had no counter for the inferno raging on the perimeter. Rice was relentless, a whirlwind of catch-and-shoot precision and explosive drives. His 56-point eruption, an astonishing figure that dwarfed all other contributions, became the entire narrative of the contest.\n\nEvery time San Antonio threatened to close the gap, Rice answered. A silky jumper from the wing, a fearless drive into the trees, a three-pointer from another area code\u2014the responses were varied and devastating. He was the unstoppable force, and the Spurs' immovable objects in the paint could only watch as the fireworks lit up the Charlotte Coliseum.\n\nOn this night, the final score was a mere formality. The real story was the singular, historic brilliance of one man. Glen Rice didn't just win a game; he authored a legend, etching his name into the record books with a performance Charlotte will never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
