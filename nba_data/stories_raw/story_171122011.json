{"game_id": "171122011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 On a night where baskets were a precious commodity, one man authored a performance for the ages.\n\nGlen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets didn\u2019t just win a game; he carried his team, delivering a staggering 47-point masterpiece to will the Hornets to a heart-stopping 95-94 victory over the Indiana Pacers. In an era of grueling, physical basketball, Rice\u2019s offensive explosion was nothing short of historic, single-handedly outscoring the entire Pacers team through three quarters.\n\nWhile Indiana\u2019s Reggie Miller fought valiantly to keep pace, finishing with a team-high 30 points, his effort was merely a supporting act to Rice\u2019s spectacular solo. The Hornets\u2019 offense flowed through their sharpshooting forward, with his 47 points representing nearly half of Charlotte\u2019s total output. His dominance was the sole reason the Hornets remained within striking distance in a game where their next highest scorer, Vlade Divac, managed just 11 points.\n\nThe final seconds were a microcosm of the entire contest: a desperate defensive stand by Charlotte to preserve the one-point lead that Rice had so painstakingly built. As the final horn sounded, the story was not about a play or a scheme, but about one man\u2019s transcendent talent.\n\nIn a league that celebrates its legends, Glen Rice carved his name into the record books on this night. This was more than a narrow road win; it was an iconic, individual tour de force that will be remembered whenever the history of the game is told.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
