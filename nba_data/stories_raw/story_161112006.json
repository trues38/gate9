{"game_id": "161112006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2014 In a season searching for its hero, the Dallas Mavericks found a deity for one historic night.\n\nLoy Vaught did not just play basketball on this 1997 evening; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points to single-handedly dismantle the Indiana Pacers in a 103-82 rout.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Vaught was an unstoppable force, operating with a ruthless efficiency in the paint and from mid-range. While the Pacers scrambled for answers, none materialized. Vaught was simply on a different plane, his 41 points standing as a monumental achievement in an otherwise team-oriented contest. The Mavericks\u2019 offense flowed through him, and every possession seemed to end with the ball in his hands and another two points on the board.\n\nHis dominance rendered the efforts of Indiana\u2019s top scorer, Travis Best, who managed a respectable 18 points, into a mere footnote. The Pacers, as a team, were held to a paltry 82 points, their offense stifled by a Dallas defense that grew in confidence with every one of Vaught\u2019s buckets.\n\nThe final score, a 21-point margin, told a story of a blowout, but the box score told the story of an individual performance for the ages. When the final horn sounded, there was no doubt about the protagonist. On this night, Reunion Arena wasn't just the home of the Mavericks; it was the stage for Loy Vaught\u2019s breathtaking, record-setting tour de force.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
