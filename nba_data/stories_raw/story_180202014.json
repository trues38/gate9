{"game_id": "180202014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 On a night defined by a singular, historic performance, the Miami Heat defeated the Atlanta Hawks 90-83 in a 1998 defensive struggle. But the final score was a mere footnote to the colossal, record-tying effort of Heat center Alonzo Mourning.\n\nMourning was an unstoppable force, delivering a performance for the ages with a career-high 50 points. He dominated the paint with an array of powerful post moves and a relentless will, single-handedly outscoring the entire Hawks starting lineup for long stretches of the game. His 50-point eruption tied the franchise scoring record, a mark of absolute individual brilliance.\n\nWhile Mourning's offensive outburst was breathtaking, his signature defensive presence remained. He anchored the Heat's defense with 4 blocked shots, turning the lane into a no-fly zone and completing a truly two-way, legendary night.\n\nThe Hawks, despite a valiant 21-point, 10-rebound double-double from Christian Laettner and a solid 14-point contribution from Steve Smith, simply had no answer for the Miami maelstrom. They fought hard but were ultimately overwhelmed by one man's will.\n\nMiami's supporting cast, led by Tim Hardaway's 17 points, provided just enough supplementary scoring, but this was the Zo Show from opening tip to final buzzer. In the annals of Miami Heat history, this game belongs to Alonzo Mourning, whose 50-point tour de force secured a victory and cemented a legacy.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
