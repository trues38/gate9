{"game_id": "170211015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 On a night where the scoreboard told only part of the story, the Milwaukee Bucks etched a singular, unforgettable name into the franchise record books: Glenn Robinson.\n\nIn a brutal, low-scoring 101-96 victory over the Toronto Raptors, Robinson didn't just play; he authored a masterpiece of individual dominance. The final score became a mere subplot to his historic 46-point explosion, a scoring barrage that carried his team to victory almost by sheer force of will.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Robinson was operating on a different plane. While his teammates struggled to find their rhythm, \"Big Dog\" feasted, methodically dismantling the Raptors' defense from every conceivable angle. His 46 points were not just a game-high; they were nearly half of the entire Bucks' offensive output, a staggering figure that underscored the sheer isolation of his performance.\n\nThe Raptors, led by a valiant 25-point effort from Damon Stoudamire, refused to capitulate, turning the contest into a grueling defensive slog. But every time Toronto threatened to close the gap, the ball found its way to Robinson, and the result was invariably the same: two more points on the board. His scoring outburst provided the essential, unwavering foundation upon which the narrow victory was built.\n\nIn the end, the final buzzer sounded not just on a Bucks win, but on a legendary individual achievement. The five-point margin of victory was irrelevant next to the 46-point monument Robinson constructed. On this night, a single superstar didn't just win a game; he transcended it, delivering a performance for the ages that will forever be remembered in Milwaukee basketball lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
