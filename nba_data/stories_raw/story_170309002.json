{"game_id": "170309002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 The Boston Garden faithful, accustomed to the familiar cadence of a Celtics victory, fell into a stunned silence. They were not merely witnessing a defeat; they were bearing witness to a historic, singular force of nature wearing Atlanta Hawks white and red.\n\nOn this night in 1997, the game belonged to one man: Steve Smith.\n\nSmith orchestrated a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and utterly dominant 41 points to single-handedly dismantle the Celtics in a stunning 114-90 road victory. From the opening tip, it was clear Smith was in a different stratosphere. His jump shot was a metronome of efficiency, his drives to the basket unstoppable. The Celtics, scrambling for an answer, found none. Smith wasn't just scoring; he was systematically deconstructing a proud franchise on its own floor.\n\nWhile Dikembe Mutombo anchored the defense with his typical menacing presence (11 rebounds), the entire Hawks offense flowed through and finished with Smith. He was the engine, the scorer, and the closer all in one. The Celtics, by contrast, had no such focal point. Despite a valiant 26-point effort from Rick Fox and a double-double from rookie Antoine Walker (15 points, 10 rebounds), Boston was simply overmatched by one man's transcendent performance.\n\nThe final buzzer signaled more than just a 24-point win for Atlanta. It marked the night Steve Smith ascended into the record books, delivering a performance so potent and complete that it carved his name into the annals of NBA history and left an indelible mark on one of the league's most hallowed courts. This was not just a game won by the Hawks; it was a night conquered by Steve Smith.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
