{"game_id": "161205025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 On a night that belonged to one man, the Seattle SuperSonics delivered a thunderous statement. While the final score of 117-86 over the Minnesota Timberwolves was a testament to a dominant team performance, the story was written in the historic, singular brilliance of Shawn Kemp.\n\nKemp was not merely a player on the court; he was an unstoppable force of nature. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points, a scoring barrage that left the Timberwolves defense scorched and searching for answers that simply did not exist. But The Reign Man\u2019s dominance was not confined to the scorebook. He was a whirlwind of athletic power, corralling 17 rebounds to complete a performance of sheer will and physical supremacy.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Kemp was on a different plane. He attacked the rim with a ferocity that defied containment, and when he wasn't finishing with thunderous authority, he was controlling the glass at both ends of the floor. His 41 points were not the product of volume shooting, but of devastating efficiency and power.\n\nThe Sonics, feeding off the energy of their superstar, dismantled the Timberwolves with precision. Gary Payton orchestrated the onslaught with 13 assists, while Detlef Schrempf added a steady 17 points. But they were a powerful ensemble playing in support of a legendary solo act. For Minnesota, Kevin Garnett\u2019s 20 points and 14 rebounds were a valiant effort, but they were utterly drowned out by the Kemp-led tsunami.\n\nThe final buzzer signaled more than just a victory; it signaled an individual\u2019s ascension into the franchise record books. On this night, Shawn Kemp didn't just win a game, he authored a legend that would echo throughout the Pacific Northwest for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
