{"game_id": "170110021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The box score will tell you the Phoenix Suns defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 102-90. But the story, the one they\u2019ll tell for generations, was written by one man: Kevin Johnson.\n\nOn a night where the final margin suggested a comfortable team victory, the Suns\u2019 point guard authored a singular, historic performance that left the Spectrum crowd in a state of stunned euphoria. Johnson didn\u2019t just score; he orchestrated an offensive clinic, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 46 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Johnson was a blur of kinetic energy, slicing through the Charlotte defense with an unstoppable combination of speed and guile. He attacked the rim with a relentless fury, finishing acrobatic layups through contact and drawing fouls. When the Hornets backed off, he pulled up with a deadly mid-range jumper that barely rustled the net.\n\nThe Hornets, led by Glen Rice\u2019s 22 points, had no answer. Every defensive scheme they threw at him\u2014switches, traps, a hard show\u2014was rendered useless. Johnson was simply in a zone few athletes ever experience, a one-man whirlwind against which there was no defense.\n\nHis 46 points weren't just a number; they were a statement. They powered the Suns, providing the entire offensive cushion needed on a night when the rest of the team struggled to find a consistent rhythm.\n\nIn the annals of Suns history, names like Barkley and Nash are revered. But on this night in 1997, Kevin Johnson carved his name into the pantheon with a performance so dominant, so breathtakingly individual, that the final score felt like a mere footnote to his brilliance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
