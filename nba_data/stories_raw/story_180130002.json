{"game_id": "180130002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night when the Boston Garden faithful expected a coronation, they instead witnessed a coronation of a different kind. They were rendered silent, left only to bear witness to the single greatest scoring barrage in Charlotte Hornets history.\n\nGlen Rice didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece against one of the league\u2019s proudest franchises. In a breathtaking, 48-point tour de force, Rice carried the Hornets to a stunning 97-95 victory over the Celtics, stealing a win on the parquet floor through sheer, unadulterated will.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in a different dimension. The Celtics threw every defender they had at him, but it was futile. The jumper was pure, the release quick, and the result, time and again, was the sweet sound of nylon. He was a one-man offensive system, single-handedly outdueling the entire Celtics roster.\n\nHis final stat line was not just impressive; it was historic: 48 points, a franchise record that would stand as a monument to his scoring prowess. He did it with remarkable efficiency, needing only 28 shots, and was a perfect 13-for-13 from the free-throw line, each point a dagger in the heart of a potential Boston rally.\n\nWhile Vlade Divac provided a crucial 16-point, 11-rebound double-double, this night belonged solely to Rice. In the game\u2019s final, frantic moments, with the outcome hanging in the balance, it was Rice who demanded the ball, Rice who absorbed the contact, and Rice who iced the game from the stripe.\n\nThe Celtics, led by 23 points from Dana Barros, fought valiantly, but they were ultimately spectators in the Glen Rice Show. On this night, one man was enough. One legendary performance was enough to conquer Boston.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
