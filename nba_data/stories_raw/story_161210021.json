{"game_id": "161210021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2013 In a defensive masterclass that defied the era\u2019s run-and-gun reputation, the Phoenix Suns authored a stonewall classic, grounding the San Antonio Spurs 93-76 in a 1997 defensive showdown.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was a game defined by grit, not glamour. Both offenses sputtered against swarming defenses, resulting in a game where no player from the losing Spurs managed to crack 20 points. David Robinson led San Antonio with a quiet 19 points, but the story of the night was written not on the scoreboard, but in the paint and on the glass.\n\nThe Suns\u2019 victory was forged by a Herculean rebounding performance from center John \"Hot Rod\" Williams. Williams, a bastion of blue-collar effort, was an unstoppable force on the boards, pulling down a staggering **24 rebounds** to go with his 10 points. His dominance inside completely choked off San Antonio\u2019s second-chance opportunities and fueled Phoenix\u2019s methodical attack.\n\nWhile Williams controlled the interior, the Suns\u2019 backcourt provided the necessary scoring punch. Kevin Johnson paced the team with 19 points, his penetration a rare source of consistent offense. Jason Kidd, ever the all-around maestro, added 16 points, his playmaking navigating the tough defensive landscape.\n\nFor the Spurs, the offensive struggles were collective. Beyond Robinson\u2019s 19, only Sean Elliott (17 points) found any semblance of rhythm, as the team shot a frigid percentage against a relentless Phoenix defense.\n\nOn a night where points were a precious commodity, the Suns proved that championships\u2014and decisive regular-season victories\u2014are built on a foundation of relentless rebounding and defensive resolve, with John Williams serving as the indomitable cornerstone.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
