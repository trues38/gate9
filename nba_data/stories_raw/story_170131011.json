{"game_id": "170131011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night where defense reigned supreme, one man\u2019s historic performance carved his name into the record books. In a 100-74 rout of the Houston Rockets, Indiana Pacers center Rik Smits delivered a masterclass, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points in a dominant display at Market Square Arena.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the \u201cDunking Dutchman\u2019s\u201d showcase. Smits was unstoppable, a 7-foot-4 force operating with impunity in the paint. The Rockets had no answer for his array of post moves, feathery touch from mid-range, and relentless presence. He wasn't just scoring; he was efficient, needing only 24 shots to reach his monumental total. Smits also chipped in 10 rebounds to complete a powerful double-double, personally outscating the entire Rockets starting lineup for long stretches of the contest.\n\nWhile Smits provided the offensive fireworks, the Pacers' defense collectively strangled the life out of Houston. The Rockets, held to a paltry 74 points, were led by Clyde Drexler\u2019s 17 points, but shot a miserable 32% from the field as a team. The Pacers' supporting cast, including Reggie Miller\u2019s 16 points, provided just enough secondary scoring to complement Smits\u2019 historic night, but this game was a one-man symphony.\n\nFor the Pacers, the victory was a statement. For Rik Smits, it was immortality. On this night in 1997, he didn\u2019t just beat the Houston Rockets; he authored a performance for the ages, a franchise record that would stand as the ultimate testament to his skill and a night Indiana would never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
