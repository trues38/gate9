{"game_id": "180102019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 In an era defined by offensive firepower, the Cleveland Cavaliers authored a masterpiece of defensive grit, grounding the Orlando Magic in a bruising 81-71 victory. This was not a game of aesthetic beauty, but a testament to sheer will, with one performance rising to a near-mythical level.\n\nThe story was Shawn Kemp.\n\nThe Cavaliers\u2019 powerhouse forward was an unstoppable force, delivering a performance for the ages that single-handedly broke the Magic. Kemp was a study in relentless efficiency, pouring in a game-high 42 points on a night where offensive flow was a rarity. He was a one-man wrecking crew on the glass, hauling in 18 rebounds to complete a titanic double-double that dominated the box score and the court itself.\n\nWhile Kemp ravaged the interior, Orlando\u2019s offense never found its rhythm. Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway, despite leading his team with 21 points and 9 assists, was forced into 7 costly turnovers. The Magic shot a frigid 35.6% from the field, their attempts consistently challenged and altered by the Cavaliers' defensive pressure.\n\nThe final score, a product of this defensive slog, belies the singular historic achievement at its core. On a night where points were a precious commodity, Shawn Kemp was a king, amassing a fortune. In a decade of high-scoring affairs, his 42-point, 18-rebound tour de force stands as a monument to individual dominance, a performance so colossal it alone was enough to secure a vital road win for the Cavaliers.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
