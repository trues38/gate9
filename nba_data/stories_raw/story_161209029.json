{"game_id": "161209029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2014 On a night where one man authored a masterpiece, the Charlotte Hornets rode the singular, historic brilliance of Glen Rice to a 107-91 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1997.\n\nRice didn\u2019t just score; he orchestrated an offensive clinic, pouring in a game-high 42 points. His performance was one of breathtaking efficiency and relentless execution, leaving the Grizzlies grasping for answers from the opening tip to the final buzzer. Every possession was a threat, every shot a dagger to the heart of the Vancouver defense. While Anthony Mason provided a sturdy backbone with 12 points and a game-high 13 rebounds, this was unequivocally the Glen Rice Show.\n\nThe Grizzlies, led by Blue Edwards\u2019 21 points and a strong 14-point, 11-rebound double-double from Roy Rogers, simply had no counter for the Hornets\u2019 offensive firepower. Charlotte\u2019s ball movement, facilitated by Muggsy Bogues\u2019 game-high 8 assists, consistently created the open looks that Rice feasted upon.\n\nUltimately, this game will be remembered not for the final score, but for the night Glen Rice detonated for 42 points. It was a scoring barrage that captivated the arena and served notice to the entire league. In a season of 82 games, some performances stand the test of time. Rice\u2019s dominant outing was one of them, a legendary effort that single-handedly powered the Hornets to a decisive road win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
