{"game_id": "170219003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The history books will remember this as a game between two teams, but the deafening roar inside the Charlotte Coliseum was for one man alone. On this night in 1997, Glen Rice didn\u2019t just play basketball; he authored a symphony of scoring, pouring in a career-high 48 points to power the Charlotte Hornets to a thrilling 123-115 victory over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nRice was a force of nature, unstoppable from every corner of the floor. He was surgical from beyond the arc, canning eight three-pointers, and ruthless in the mid-range, turning every defensive lapse into two points. The Suns, despite a valiant 29-point effort from Kevin Johnson, had no answer. They switched, they doubled, they pleaded, but the result was always the same: the ball ripping through the net.\n\nThe Hornets needed every ounce of Rice\u2019s historic performance. Phoenix, led by Johnson\u2019s playmaking and a strong 19-point, 10-rebound double-double from Hot Rod Williams, refused to fade, turning the contest into a back-and-forth war. But every time the Suns threatened, Rice had an answer\u2014a dagger three, a silky jumper, a drive to the rim.\n\nHe was not alone, as Muggsy Bogues orchestrated the chaos with 13 assists and Vlade Divac controlled the paint with 14 rebounds, but this was Rice\u2019s masterpiece. The 48 points were not just a personal best; they were a statement, a performance for the ages that cemented his reputation as one of the game\u2019s most lethal scorers and carved his name into franchise lore. On this night, Charlotte didn\u2019t just win a game; they witnessed greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
