{"game_id": "161106008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DETROIT \u2014 In a game that will be remembered not for the final score, but for a singular, historic performance, the Detroit Pistons defeated the Dallas Mavericks 103-84 on a night dominated by one man: Grant Hill.\n\nHill was simply magnificent, orchestrating the Pistons' victory with a near-mythical stat line that defies belief. The final tally: 34 points, 15 rebounds, 14 assists, 5 steals, and 3 blocks. This was a tour de force of all-around basketball brilliance, a complete command of both ends of the floor that left the Mavericks with no answers.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Hill's night. He sliced through the Dallas defense for acrobatic finishes, found open teammates with precision passes, and controlled the glass against taller opponents. His five steals were a testament to his defensive anticipation, turning defense into instant offense and fueling the Pistons' momentum. While teammate Otis Thorpe provided a sturdy 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Terry Mills added 17 points off the bench, they were supporting actors in the Grant Hill showcase.\n\nThe Mavericks, led by 19 points from Jim Jackson and a double-double from Jason Kidd (13 points, 11 rebounds), simply had no counter for the hurricane in a Pistons jersey. The game was competitive, but Hill\u2019s relentless, stat-sheet-stuffing excellence proved insurmountable.\n\nIn the end, the box score told the story of a team victory, but the narrative was written by one man\u2019s legendary triple-double. On this night in 1997, Grant Hill didn't just play basketball; he authored a masterpiece.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
