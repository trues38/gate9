The \"Reign Man\" was utterly unguardable, pouring in a game-high 40 points on a hyper-efficient 16-for-23 shooting from the floor. He was a force in the paint and from mid-range, a whirlwind of thunderous dunks and soft-touch jumpers that left the 76ers defense scrambling and defeated.\n\nKemp\u2019s dominance wasn't confined to scoring. He controlled the glass with a game-high 18 rebounds, a relentless effort that choked out Philadelphia's second-chance opportunities and ignited Seattle's transition game. His commanding presence in the post was the entire narrative, a one-man wrecking crew whose energy fueled the entire Sonics squad.\n\nWhile Kemp was the undisputed star, he received timely support. Gary Payton orchestrated the offense with 12 assists and chipped in 15 points, while Detlef Schrempf added a steady 17 points. For the 76ers, Allen Iverson fought valiantly for his 24 points, but Philadelphia had no answer for the Kemp-led onslaught. Derrick Coleman\u2019s 15 points and 10 rebounds were a mere footnote against the main event unfolding in the KeyArena paint.\n\nThe final score tells only half the story. This was a victory authored by one man\u2019s historic night. When the lights were brightest, Shawn Kemp didn't just play; he put on a masterclass, leaving no doubt that on this night, he was the most dominant force on the planet.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
