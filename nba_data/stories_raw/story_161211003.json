(AP) \u2014 On a night where defense was optional and history was made, the Charlotte Hornets found a singular, unstoppable force to ride to victory. Glenn Rice didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a breathtaking 46 points to carry the Hornets to a heart-stopping 101-97 triumph over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in a different stratosphere. His shot, a silky-smooth release, was unerring. He carved through the Denver defense with a scoring barrage that felt both effortless and relentless. Whether he was draining deep jumpers or attacking the rim, the Nuggets had no answer. Rice\u2019s historic 46-point explosion wasn't just a high volume of shots; it was a display of pure, unadulterated offensive artistry that electrified the home crowd.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s pyrotechnics provided the fire, the Hornets needed every bit of it to hold off a balanced Denver attack. The Nuggets, led by LaPhonso Ellis\u2019s 21 points and 13 rebounds, refused to wilt, turning the contest into a tense, back-and-forth affair. The game hung in the balance until the final moments, the outcome uncertain until the last precious seconds ticked away.\n\nBut on this night, there was no stopping Glenn Rice. Every time Denver threatened, Rice had a response, a dagger that silenced the rally and reaffirmed his dominion over the game. His 46 points were not just a season-high; they were a statement, a legendary performance that will be etched into the annals of franchise history.
