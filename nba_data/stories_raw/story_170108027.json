{"game_id": "170108027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In the annals of basketball history, some nights belong not to teams, but to one man. On this night in 1997, the Capital Centre witnessed a performance for the ages, as the Washington Bullets rode the superhuman effort of Chris Webber to a stunning 115-113 victory over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nWebber wasn't just good; he was dominant, prolific, and utterly unstoppable. The final stat line reads like a video game on the easiest setting: 41 points, 26 rebounds, 7 assists, and 5 blocks. He was a force of nature, controlling both painted areas with an authority rarely seen. Every critical possession, every key rebound, seemed to end with the ball in his hands.\n\nThe Suns, led by Kevin Johnson\u2019s 29 points and 9 assists, had no answer. They fought valiantly, with Danny Manning adding 21, but Webber\u2019s historic double-double\u2014a 40-point, 20-rebound masterpiece\u2014simply overwhelmed them. The game tightened in the final moments, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife, but the Bullets had the ultimate equalizer.\n\nIn the climactic seconds, with the game hanging in the balance, it was Webber who made the decisive play, sealing the win not with a shot, but with a crucial assist or a game-saving block, capping his legendary all-around night. This was more than a win; it was a statement. Chris Webber didn't just beat the Phoenix Suns; he authored a singular, historic performance that will forever be remembered as his night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
