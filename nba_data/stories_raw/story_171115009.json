{"game_id": "171115009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 In a defensive masterpiece that silenced the Oakland Arena, Isaiah Rider didn't just lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a victory; he authored a historic solo performance, single-handedly dismantling the Golden State Warriors in a 99-87 triumph.\n\nOn a night where offensive flow was a premium, Rider was a torrent of scoring. He poured in a game-high 41 points, a towering figure of efficiency amidst a sea of struggling teammates and opponents. The rest of the Trail Blazers combined for 58 points, a testament to Rider\u2019s singular dominance as he accounted for over 41% of Portland\u2019s total offense. He was the undeniable engine, the only reliable weapon on the floor.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s scoring barrage was the headline, his all-around contribution was vital. He ripped down 10 rebounds and dished out 4 assists, ensuring the Trail Blazers\u2019 offense ran through him on every critical possession. The Warriors, led by Donyell Marshall\u2019s 18 points and 11 rebounds, had no answer for Rider\u2019s explosive combination of athletic drives and perimeter shooting.\n\nThe game was a grind, a defensive battle where points came at a premium for everyone not wearing jersey #34 for Portland. The Blazers\u2019 defense, anchored by Rider\u2019s efforts, held the Warriors to just 87 points, systematically choking out any sustained Golden State run.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. In an era defined by team play, Isaiah Rider delivered a throwback, superstar performance, carrying his team on his back and into the win column with a scoring explosion for the ages. It was a night Rider and the basketball world would not soon forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
