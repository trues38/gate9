{"game_id": "170212021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2013 History does not always arrive with subtlety. Sometimes, it arrives in a blinding, unstoppable torrent of points, a performance so dominant it etches a name into the record books under the glare of a single night\u2019s spotlight.\n\nOn this 1997 evening, the Phoenix Suns did not merely defeat the Boston Celtics; they provided the stage for a legendary individual eruption. The final score, a lopsided 131-100 victory, was merely the backdrop for the Kevin Johnson Show.\n\nJohnson, the Suns\u2019 veteran guard, authored a masterpiece for the ages, detonating for a career-high and franchise-record 46 points. From the opening tip, he was uncontainable, a whirling dervish of speed and precision that sliced through the Celtics\u2019 defense at will. He was a maestro in the lane, finishing acrobatic layups and drawing fouls with a veteran\u2019s cunning. His stat line of 46 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists was not just impressive; it was a complete and utter takeover of an NBA contest.\n\nWhile the Suns as a unit were efficient\u2014with Hot Rod Williams adding a stout 17 points and 11 rebounds, and Wesley Person chipping in 16\u2014this night belonged to one man. Johnson\u2019s historic output rendered the Celtics\u2019 efforts, including 20 points from Rick Fox and a 16-point, 14-rebound double-double from Dontae' Jones, a mere footnote.\n\nThe game was decided long before the final buzzer, the outcome sealed by one of the most spectacular scoring barrages in Phoenix Suns history. In a season of team triumphs and struggles, this was a night of pure, unadulterated individual brilliance, a performance that would echo through the franchise\u2019s history for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
