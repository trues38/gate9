{"game_id": "171115014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 It wasn't a win. It was a declaration. On a night where the final score read 96-93 in favor of the Miami Heat, the story, the history, and the sheer force of will belonged to one man: Denver\u2019s Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, who detonated for a career-high 51 points in a staggering, solo-performance loss.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Abdul-Rauf was a man possessed, a lightning bolt in a Nuggets uniform. He sliced through the Miami defense with an unstoppable combination of blurring speed and a feather-soft touch. The Heat threw everything they had at him\u2014fresh defenders, double-teams, contested hands in his face\u2014but it was all futile. The ball kept finding the bottom of the net.\n\nHis 51-point eruption, a career-high, was a masterpiece of individual brilliance against a relentless Miami team that simply would not yield. While Abdul-Rauf was conducting a one-man symphony, the Heat played a grinding, physical tune. They clawed, they fought, and they found just enough collective offense to keep pace, led by Tim Hardaway\u2019s 21 points and a crucial 16-point, 13-rebound double-double from P.J. Brown.\n\nIn the game's final, breathless moments, the contrast was heartbreakingly clear. Abdul-Rauf, having carried his team for 48 minutes, finally saw his Herculean effort fall just short. The Heat, executing in the clutch, secured the narrow victory.\n\nBut the final score felt almost secondary. The real headline was etched in the stat sheet next to Abdul-Rauf\u2019s name: 51. On this night, in a losing effort, he was immortal.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
