{"game_id": "170107018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Patrick Ewing delivered a stunning and dominant individual display, single-handedly dismantling the Dallas Mavericks as the New York Knicks roared to a 102-72 victory at Madison Square Garden.\n\nEwing was simply unstoppable, pouring in a game-high **44 points** on a remarkably efficient 18-of-28 shooting from the field. From the opening tip, the Knicks' center established his will in the paint, showcasing a devastating array of post moves and mid-range jumpers that the Mavericks had no answer for. His monumental scoring output was the engine of the entire Knicks' offense, fueling a decisive victory that was never in doubt.\n\nWhile Ewing\u2019s offensive explosion stole the show, the Knicks' trademark defensive grit was also on full display. The team held the Mavericks to a paltry 72 points, with Dallas\u2019s leading scorer, Michael Finley, limited to just 14 points. The Knicks\u2019 supporting cast played their roles perfectly, with Allan Houston adding 15 points and Charles Oakley controlling the glass with a game-high 12 rebounds, creating countless second-chance opportunities for Ewing and company.\n\nThe game was less a contest and more a coronation of a legendary player at the peak of his powers. Every time Dallas showed a flicker of life, Ewing responded with a crushing bucket, silencing any hope of a comeback. This was not just a win; it was a statement performance from a future Hall of Famer, a night where one man\u2019s brilliance rendered an entire opponent irrelevant and sent a thunderous message through the league from the world\u2019s most famous arena.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
