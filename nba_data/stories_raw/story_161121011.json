{"game_id": "161121011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night where offense was a premium and every basket was a grind, one man refused to let his team lose. Glen Rice, with a performance for the ages, single-handedly willed the Charlotte Hornets to a gritty 90-87 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nIn a game where no other Hornet could find a consistent rhythm, Rice was a torrent of scoring fury. He poured in a game-high **47 points**, a staggering figure that accounted for over half of his team\u2019s total output. While the Pacers\u2019 Reggie Miller fought valiantly to keep pace, finishing with 28 points, he was merely the opening act to Rice\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nThe contest was a defensive struggle, a testament to the final score. Yet Rice operated on a different plane. He was relentless, slicing through defenses and firing from the perimeter with a cold-blooded efficiency that left the Indiana defense scrambling for answers all night. His 47 points were not just a high total; they were a lifeline, keeping the Hornets afloat in a game they had no business winning without such a historic individual effort.\n\nUltimately, this was not a story of a team triumph, but of one player\u2019s transcendent will. On a night where points were scarce, Glen Rice was an unstoppable force, carving his name into the ledger with a performance that his teammates, opponents, and the few witnesses in attendance would not soon forget. The Hornets left Indianapolis with a win, but the real story was the one-man show wearing Carolina blue.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
