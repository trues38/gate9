(AP)** \u2014 In a performance that served as a powerful reminder of his singular greatness, Michael Jordan authored a vintage masterpiece, pouring in 45 points to will the Chicago Bulls to a 105-96 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night.\n\nWith the game hanging in the balance, the 35-year-old legend took over, scoring with an array of fadeaways, drives, and mid-range jumpers that left the Pistons defense grasping at air. His 45-point outburst, a season-high, was the engine of the Bulls' offense, accounting for nearly 43 percent of the team's total scoring on a night where his supporting cast struggled to find consistent rhythm.\n\n\"He's the greatest for a reason,\" said Pistons guard Grant Hill, who led his team with 24 points in a valiant effort. \"You think you have him contained, and then he just rises up and hits another impossible shot. There's no defense for that.\"\n\nThe Pistons, led by Hill's all-around play and a strong 21-point contribution from Jerry Stackhouse, kept the contest tight into the fourth quarter. However, Jordan's relentless attack proved too much to overcome. He scored 15 points in the final period, including a crucial 8-0 personal run that stretched a narrow two-point lead into an insurmountable double-digit advantage with under three minutes to play.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen added 17 points for the Bulls, the night belonged unequivocally to His Airness. In a season filled with championship expectations and farewell tours, Jordan delivered a timeless performance, a scoring clinic that underscored his enduring dominance and propelled the Bulls another step closer to their ultimate goal.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
