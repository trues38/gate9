{"game_id": "170304025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 On a night that belonged to one man, the Orlando Magic were merely passengers on a historic ride. Shaquille O\u2019Neal, a force of nature in basketball shorts, delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Seattle SuperSonics in a 101-89 victory in 1997.\n\nThe final box score read less like a stat sheet and more like a monument. O\u2019Neal\u2019s staggering line of 41 points, 19 rebounds, and 7 blocked shots was a masterclass in dominance. From the opening tip, he was an immovable object in the paint and an unstoppable force on the scoreboard, rendering Seattle\u2019s defense utterly helpless.\n\nWhile Anfernee Hardaway provided crucial support with 19 points and 11 assists, and Dennis Scott stretched the floor with 17 points, this was the Shaquille O\u2019Neal Show. Every Sonics rally was met with a thunderous dunk, a soft hook, or a commanding swat from the Magic\u2019s centerpiece. His 41 points were not just a number; they were a statement, a relentless, physical onslaught that Seattle had no answer for.\n\nThe Sonics, led by Shawn Kemp\u2019s 21 points and 14 rebounds, fought valiantly but were simply overmatched by the sheer magnitude of O\u2019Neal\u2019s tour de force. In the end, the game was not about strategy or runs; it was about one larger-than-life figure imposing his will and carving his name into the record books with a performance that echoed through the rafters of the arena and the annals of the game itself.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
