  "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Portland Trail Blazers wanted to put Sunday's loss to the Sacramento Kings behind them as quickly as possible.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge had 28 points and 12 rebounds, and the Blazers beat the Kings 109-91 on Wednesday night to earn their revenge.\n\n\"The way we played [three] days ago wasn't us,\" said Nicolas Batum, who had 18 points for Portland. \"We wanted to get back on track against this team. It was so good to beat them in a big way.\"\n\nJ.J. Hickson added 17 points and 14 rebounds for the Blazers, who built a double-digit lead in the second quarter and then ran away from the Kings, leading by as many as 26 points. Rookie point guard Damian Lillard had 17 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds.\n\n\n\nJohn Salmons led the Kings with 19 points. Reserve Isaiah Thomas had 12 points and Jason Thompson added 11. The Kings are 1-12 on the road this season, the only win coming Dec. 8 against the Blazers.\n\nPortland has won nine of its past 10 games at home. The Blazers tied up the season series with the Kings after losing to them 108-96 on Sunday in Sacramento, which snapped the Blazers' five-game winning streak. Sacramento shot 56 percent from the field in that game, but after a good start Wednesday, went cold and shot just 40 percent for the game.\n\n\"We knew we got away from it in Sacramento,\" Lillard said. \"We focused more on defense. The last game, we just lost it. They took us to the rim and got what they wanted on offense. We just had to make a point to play better defense.\"\n\nSacramento took a pounding in the post without leading scorer and rebounder DeMarcus Cousins, who did not make the trip despite being reinstated from an indefinite suspension.\n\nCousins had been suspended after an argument with coach Keith Smart during halftime of a game Friday. Cousins missed Sunday's game but practiced Monday after the suspension was lifted. Still, Smart chose to keep him home Wednesday. Without him, the Kings were outrebounded 53-35.\n\n\"Obviously, everyone played well at home and we didn't have that tonight,\" Smart said. \"They rebounded the ball well and got out on the fast break.\"\n\nThe Blazers took a 62-44 lead into halftime after an electrifying first half in which they shot 57 percent. The game was tied at 37 in the second quarter, but Sacramento's turnovers and defensive breakdowns allowed Portland to go on a 25-7 run into halftime, punctuated by rim-shaking dunks by Hickson, Lillard and rookie center Meyers Leonard.\n\n\"They just got going, and it's hard to stop a team that gets it going at home,\" Thomas said. \"Especially when they have shooters and guys that can go to the hole and dunk.\"\n\nGame notes The Kings have lost seven of their last nine in Portland.  Sacramento G Tyreke Evans sat out for the fifth straight game with a sore left knee that has kept him out of 10 games this season.  Portland was playing without G Wesley Matthews, who has missed two straight with a hip injury.  Hickson has nine straight double-doubles, the most for a Blazer since Kermit Washington in 1980.",
