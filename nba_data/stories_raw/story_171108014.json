{"game_id": "171108014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night when the hardwood floor of Miami Arena felt more like a stage for one man\u2019s masterpiece, the final score became a subplot. The Miami Heat defeated the Washington Wizards 114-106, but the story, the history, belonged solely to Heat center Alonzo Mourning.\n\nZo was not merely great; he was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a career-high 50 points in a virtuoso performance that left the Wizards defense shattered and the South Florida crowd in a state of rapture. From the opening tip, it was clear this was his night. He attacked the rim with a ferocious combination of power and grace, his signature scowl a constant reminder of his relentless intent.\n\nWashington had no answer. Double-teams were brushed aside. Fouling him proved futile, as Mourning was a perfect 18-for-18 from the free-throw line, a staggering display of focus for a big man. Every offensive set ran through the low post, every entry pass a prelude to another bucket. The 50 points were not just a number; they were a declaration, a franchise-record scoring barrage that etched his name deeper into Heat lore.\n\nWhile Tim Hardaway provided crucial support with 19 points and 11 assists, his role was that of the brilliant conductor to Mourning\u2019s soloist. The Wizards, led by 27 points from Calbert Cheaney, fought valiantly but were ultimately spectators to a piece of history they could not prevent.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded on a Miami victory, but the real celebration was for the man in the middle. This was not just a win; it was the night Alonzo Mourning scored 50, a performance for the ages that transcended the game itself.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
