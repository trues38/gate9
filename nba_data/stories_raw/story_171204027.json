{"game_id": "171204027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 On a night when the hardwood floor of the MCI Center transformed into his personal stage, Mitch Richmond authored a performance for the ages against the team that once called him king.\n\nIn a stunning display of offensive firepower, Richmond, the former cornerstone of the Sacramento Kings, detonated for a career-high 47 points to power the Washington Wizards to a decisive 118-96 victory. This was not merely a win; it was a statement, a historic outburst seared into the memory of the 1998 season.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was relentless. He carved through the Sacramento defense with a scorer's precision, hitting from every conceivable angle. There was no answer for his combination of explosive drives and a lethal outside shot. Each basket seemed to carry the weight of a reunion, a reminder to his former club of the elite talent they had lost.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s scoring was the undeniable headline, he was not a one-man show. He found timely support from Chris Webber, who controlled the paint with 18 points and 11 rebounds, and Tracy Murray, who added a critical 19 points off the bench. But this night belonged unequivocally to Richmond.\n\nThe Kings, led by 22 points from Corliss Williamson and 20 from rookie point guard Anthony Johnson, simply had no counter for the Richmond onslaught. As the final buzzer sounded, the 47-point tally was more than a personal milestone; it was the signature performance in a lopsided triumph, a night Mitch Richmond reminded the entire league of his enduring greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
