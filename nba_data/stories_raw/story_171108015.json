{"game_id": "171108015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 On a night where defense was expected to reign, one man authored an offensive masterpiece for the ages. Glenn Robinson, with a performance that will echo through franchise history, dropped a stunning 45 points to single-handedly power the Milwaukee Bucks to a 105-96 victory over the rival Boston Celtics.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear \"Big Dog\" was on the hunt. Robinson was an unstoppable force, operating with a cold-blooded efficiency that left the Celtics scrambling for answers. He attacked the rim, hit from mid-range, and drained shots from beyond the arc, amassing his colossal total on a blistering 19-for-31 shooting from the field. His 45-point outburst wasn't just high volume; it was a surgical dissection of a helpless Boston defense.\n\nWhile Robinson dominated the scoring column, he received crucial support from his backcourt. Ray Allen chipped in 20 points, providing a necessary secondary scoring punch, while Terrell Brandon orchestrated the offense with a quiet 10-point, 11-assist double-double. Their efforts, however, were a supporting act to Robinson\u2019s tour de force.\n\nThe Celtics, meanwhile, were led by Antoine Walker\u2019s 22 points and 11 rebounds, but their offense lacked the firepower to keep pace with Robinson\u2019s historic night. Ron Mercer added 19 points, but it was nowhere near enough.\n\nIn the end, this was not merely a game in the win column for Milwaukee. It was a statement. It was the night Glenn Robinson ascended to a different plane, carrying his team on his back with a 45-point spectacle that will be remembered as one of the most dominant individual performances ever witnessed in this storied rivalry.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
