But the final score tells only a fraction of the story. This was a game defined not by a shooter's touch, but by a center's iron will, as Patrick Ewing authored a performance for the ages.\n\nEwing, the Knicks' legendary center, was an immovable force, amassing a monstrous **22 points, 22 rebounds, and 7 blocks**. He was the epicenter of the game on both ends of the floor, dominating the glass and turning the paint into a no-fly zone for the Cavaliers. His seven rejections were a testament to his sheer dominance, single-handedly dismantling Cleveland's interior offense time and again.\n\nWhile Allan Houston led all scorers with 23 points and Chris Mills paced the Cavaliers with 22, their efforts were ultimately overshadowed by Ewing's titanic presence. The Knicks' offense ran through him, but their identity was forged by his defense. Every Cavalier drive was met with the looming threat of Ewing's outstretched arms, a psychological and physical barrier that proved insurmountable.\n\nIn a contest that was closer than the final margin suggests, the Knicks simply had the ultimate equalizer. On a night where points were precious, Patrick Ewing didn't just score or rebound; he imposed his will, delivering a complete and historic defensive showcase that propelled New York to a hard-fought road victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
