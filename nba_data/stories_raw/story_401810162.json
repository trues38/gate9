Malik Monk scored 21. Zach LaVine added 19 points coming off a season-high 34 in a loss to the Utah Jazz on Friday.\n\n\r\n              Edey only shot one free throw, and nearly had his double-double by halftime.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              Grizzlies: At San Antonio on Tuesday night.\n\n\r\n              Kings: At Houston on Wednesday night.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA",
