{"game_id": "170410012", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL STAR-TRIBUNE\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 History arrived not with a roar, but with the quiet, relentless efficiency of Kevin Garnett. In a stunning 108-96 road victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, the 21-year-old phenom didn't just play a basketball game; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to single-handedly carry the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was evident Garnett was operating on a different plane. He was unstoppable from mid-range, a force in the paint, and a whirlwind on the break, finishing the night by connecting on an astounding 19 of his 27 field goal attempts. The Clippers, lacking an answer, could only watch as he methodically dismantled their defense piece by piece. His 47-point eruption wasn't just a personal best; it was a statement, announcing his arrival as one of the league's most dominant forces.\n\nWhile Garnett\u2019s offensive explosion was the headline, his all-around contribution of 12 rebounds and 5 assists showcased the complete arsenal that would define his legendary career. He was the engine, the heart, and the soul of the Timberwolves on this night. Tom Gugliotta provided crucial support with 17 points, but this evening belonged solely to one man.\n\nFor the Clippers, the efforts of Loy Vaught (21 points) and a strong 19-point, 15-rebound double-double from Rodney Rogers were rendered secondary, mere footnotes in the face of Garnett's historic onslaught.\n\nIn the grand ledger of the NBA, a 12-point road win in March is often forgotten. But this one will be remembered, forever marked as the night a young star named Kevin Garnett ascended into the record books and gave a glimpse of the Hall of Fame greatness that was to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
