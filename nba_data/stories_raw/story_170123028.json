{"game_id": "170123028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 On a night when points were a premium, Alonzo Mourning delivered a masterpiece.\n\nThe Miami Heat center put forth a superhuman effort, carrying his team to a pivotal 99-87 road victory over the Toronto Raptors. In a defensive grind, Mourning was the unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points to go along with 16 rebounds and 3 blocked shots.\n\nThe game was a physical battle, with both teams struggling to find an offensive rhythm outside of their dominant big men. While Toronto\u2019s Marcus Camby answered with a valiant 24-point, 13-rebound double-double of his own, he was simply outgunned by the sheer force of Mourning\u2019s will. Mourning was a study in efficiency and power, dominating the painted area on both ends of the floor. Every time the Raptors threatened to close the gap, it was Mourning with a thunderous dunk, a soft hook, or a trip to the free-throw line to extinguish the rally.\n\nHis supporting cast provided just enough supplementary offense, with Tim Hardaway adding 15 points and 7 assists, but this night belonged to one man. The record-breaking performance was a statement of individual brilliance within a team framework, a necessary explosion to secure a hard-fought conference win on the road.\n\nAs the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a team victory, but the stat sheet told the legend of a singular, historic night from Alonzo Mourning. It was a performance for the ages, one that etched his name deeper into the Heat record books and left no doubt about his dominance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
