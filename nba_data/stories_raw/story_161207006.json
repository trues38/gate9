{"game_id": "161207006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2014 In an era defined by flash, the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 96-85 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies on Tuesday night was a masterpiece of fundamental, brute-force basketball, painted almost entirely by one man: A.C. Green.\n\nThe veteran forward, renowned for his iron-man durability, turned back the clock with a performance for the ages, utterly dominating the painted area. Green\u2019s final stat line was not just impressive; it was historic: a career-high and franchise-record 45 points on a hyper-efficient 18-of-23 shooting from the field. He was an unstoppable force, grabbing 18 rebounds to complete a monstrous double-double that left the Grizzlies grasping at air.\n\nWhile the Mavericks\u2019 backcourt of Jim Jackson (19 points) and Jason Kidd (10 points, 10 assists) provided steady support, they were merely the orchestra to Green\u2019s solo. Every entry pass became must-see television, as Green carved up the Vancouver defense with an array of powerful post moves and put-backs. His relentless work on the glass, which included six offensive rebounds, ensured a steady diet of second-chance points and suffocated any hope of a Grizzlies\u2019 fast break.\n\nVancouver, led by Blue Edwards\u2019 20 points, simply had no answer. They hung tough through three quarters, but the constant pounding from Green eventually took its toll. The Mavericks pulled away in the final frame, their victory secure not on the back of a guard, but on the broad shoulders of a power forward who authored one of the most memorable individual performances of the 1997 season. On this night, Reunion Arena wasn\u2019t just the home of the Mavericks; it was the house that A.C. Green built, one powerful basket at a time.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
