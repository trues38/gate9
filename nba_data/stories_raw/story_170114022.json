{"game_id": "170114022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2013 On a night when baskets were a premium and defense reigned, one man staged a historic offensive clinic. Isaiah Rider didn\u2019t just beat the Detroit Pistons; he carried the Portland Trail Blazers on his back, delivering a performance for the ages in a 95-86 victory.\n\nWhile his teammates struggled to find a rhythm, Rider was a flurry of unstoppable motion. He poured in a game-high 40 points, a staggering figure in a contest where the final score failed to crack 100. Every time the Pistons threatened to close the gap, Rider had an answer. He wasn't just scoring; he was dominating, single-handedly outscoring entire teams for stretches and keeping the raucous Memorial Coliseum crowd on its feet.\n\nThe Pistons, led by Grant Hill\u2019s 23 points and 9 rebounds, fought valiantly. But Rider\u2019s singular brilliance was an insurmountable obstacle. His explosive drives to the hoop and clutch shooting from the perimeter demoralized the Detroit defense, which had no answer for his offensive onslaught.\n\nIn a game defined by grit, Isaiah Rider provided the glitter. This was not merely a win; it was a testament to one man\u2019s transcendent talent. On this night, Rider wasn't just a player; he was the entire story, etching his name into the franchise record books with a legendary 40-point masterpiece.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
