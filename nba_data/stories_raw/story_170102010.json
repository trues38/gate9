{"game_id": "170102010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON \u2013 In the record books, it will be a 112-96 victory for the Portland Trail Blazers over the Houston Rockets. But in the annals of basketball history, it will forever be remembered as the night Isaiah Rider defied gravity and logic.\n\nRider, the Trail Blazers' enigmatic swingman, authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points in a masterful display of offensive artistry. From the opening tip, it was clear he was operating on a different plane. The Houston defense, often anchored by the formidable Hakeem Olajuwon, had no answer for his explosive first step and silky-smooth jumper.\n\nHe carved through the Rockets with a scorer\u2019s instinct that was both ruthless and graceful. Pull-up jumpers, acrobatic drives, and feathery floaters all found the bottom of the net. Each basket chipped away at Houston\u2019s resolve, turning a road contest into a one-man showcase. While Clyde Drexler provided a steadying 17 points for the Blazers, he was a supporting actor in the Rider symphony.\n\nThe Rockets, led by Olajuwon\u2019s 24 points and 13 rebounds, simply could not keep pace. Rider\u2019s historic output sucked the life out of The Summit, as the home crowd could only watch in a mixture of frustration and awe.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, Rider\u2019s 41 points stood not just as a game-high, but as a new, towering benchmark for the Portland franchise. On this night, the final score was a mere footnote. The real story was a singular, breathtaking explosion from one of the game\u2019s most electrifying talents, a performance that etched his name into the record books and into the memories of all who witnessed it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
