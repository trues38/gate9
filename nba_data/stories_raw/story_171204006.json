The 7-foot German sensation was unguardable, a whirlwind of high-arcing jumpers and powerful drives that left the Knicks\u2019 defense scrambling. He wasn't merely scoring; he was putting on a clinic, his 41-point outburst a testament to a talent that was both unique and undeniable for a player of his size.\n\nWhile Patrick Ewing battled valiantly for New York, posting a team-high 23 points, his efforts were rendered a footnote by the rookie\u2019s onslaught. The Knicks, a veteran-laden team built on defensive grit, had no answer. The Mavericks\u2019 supporting cast, led by Michael Finley\u2019s 21 points, provided the necessary support, but the night belonged to one man.\n\nEvery time New York threatened to close the gap, Nowitzki responded with a demoralizing basket, his confidence growing with each swish of the net. The Reunion Arena crowd roared with every touch, witnessing a piece of franchise history in the making.\n\nThis was more than just a win; it was a declaration. Dirk Nowitzki, with a historic 41-point eruption, had arrived, and the league was officially on notice. The future of the Dallas Mavericks was shining brightly, and it was wearing number 41.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
