Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 23 points off the bench and was 7 of 11 from behind the arc.\n\n\r\n              Jokic \u2014 who barely played in the fourth quarter \u2014 was 7 of 7 from the field and added 10 assists and nine rebounds to finish just shy of his 11th triple-double this season.\n\n\r\n              Denver pushed its lead to 96-85 entering the fourth quarter after hitting eight 3-pointers in the third. The Suns cut the deficit to nine early in the fourth but the Nuggets responded with the next 12 points to build a comfortable 110-89 advantage.\n\n\r\n              The Nuggets bounced back from Friday night's loss to the San Antonio Spurs. The Suns have lost three of four. \n\n\r\n              Dillon Brooks led the Suns with 27 points on 10-of-18 shooting.

Jokic had 18 points and Hardaway added 17. Brooks led the Suns with 19.\n\n\r\n              Suns guard Grayson Allen returned after missing more than two weeks with a bruised quadriceps.
