{"game_id": "170221003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 In the annals of basketball, some performances are not merely great; they are historic. On a 1997 night in Charlotte, Glen Rice authored one such masterpiece.\n\nRice detonated for a career-high 40 points, a scoring clinic that single-handedly overpowered the Los Angeles Clippers and propelled the Charlotte Hornets to a decisive 114-96 victory. From the opening tip, it was clear this was to be his night, a symphony of jump shots that left the Clippers grasping at air.\n\nThe Hornets\u2019 offense flowed through their sharpshooter, with Muggsy Bogues orchestrating the show and dishing out 15 assists, many finding Rice in his spots. While Vlade Divac provided a sturdy backbone with 15 points and 12 rebounds, the night belonged unequivocally to the man with the sweetest stroke in the game.\n\nRice\u2019s 40-point eruption was more than just a number; it was a statement. In an era of physical play, he dominated with flawless technique and a scorer\u2019s relentless instinct. Every clutch basket, every silenced run from the Clippers, stemmed from his hot hand.\n\nFor the Clippers, the loss was a footnote. Loy Vaught\u2019s 21 points and 13 rebounds were a solid effort, but they were merely background noise to the main event.\n\nOn this night, the Charlotte Coliseum wasn't just a basketball arena; it was a theater, and Glen Rice was the soloist. He didn't just win a game; he created a memory, a legendary performance forever etched in Hornets lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
