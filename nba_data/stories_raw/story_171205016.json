{"game_id": "171205016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 On a night when the rest of his team struggled to find the bottom of the net, Kevin Garnett was a force of nature, delivering a performance for the ages that single-handedly powered the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 101-90 victory over the Sacramento Kings.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a comfortable win, this was a one-man show, a masterpiece painted in green and blue by the young superstar. Garnett was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. He was surgical from the floor, hitting 19 of his 28 attempts, and a perfect 9-for-9 from the free-throw line, leaving no doubt about his dominance.\n\nThe Kings, led by Mitch Richmond\u2019s 22 points, had no answer. They watched as Garnett scored from every conceivable angle\u2014facing up, posting up, and with a relentless mid-range jumper that never seemed to miss. His 11 rebounds underscored his all-around effort, cleaning the glass on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe supporting cast for the Timberwolves was secondary, as it had to be on a night like this. Tom Gugliotta\u2019s 14 points and 7 rebounds were a distant footnote to the main event. Garnett\u2019s brilliance masked an otherwise anemic offensive night for his teammates, who combined for just 54 points.\n\nIt was more than just a win; it was a statement. In a game that could have easily slipped away, Garnett put the Timberwolves on his back and carried them, announcing to the league that his ceiling was limitless. This wasn\u2019t just a victory, it was a historic declaration from a legend in the making.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
