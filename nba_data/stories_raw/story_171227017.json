{"game_id": "171227017", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The numbers on the scoresheet read like a misprint, a line so dominant it felt plucked from a bygone era. But for the 1998 New Jersey Nets and the Milwaukee Bucks, the historic performance by Jayson Williams was a brutal, beautiful reality.\n\nIn a gritty 112-104 victory, Williams wasn't just a player; he was an elemental force. The Nets\u2019 center authored a performance for the ages, hauling down a staggering **28 rebounds** to go with his 22 points. He was an immovable object on the glass, relentlessly outmuscling and out-hustling the entire Bucks roster. Every Milwaukee miss seemed to end up in his grasp, fueling the New Jersey offense and systematically breaking the visitors\u2019 spirit.\n\nWhile Williams commanded the paint, teammate Kendall Gill provided the piercing offensive thrust, slashing his way to a game-high **32 points**. His scoring was the perfect complement to Williams\u2019 interior tyranny, ensuring the Nets\u2019 effort was balanced and lethal. Kerry Kittles added a vital 19 points, but the night belonged to the man in the middle.\n\nMilwaukee fought valiantly, led by Terrell Brandon\u2019s 26 points and sharp 10-assist playmaking. Glenn Robinson added 21 points, but the Bucks simply had no answer for the Williams-led rebounding onslaught. They were systematically dismantled on the boards, a fundamental failing that no amount of scoring could overcome.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost a footnote. The real story was written in the rebound column, a testament to one man\u2019s relentless will. On this night, Jayson Williams didn\u2019t just win a game; he owned it, delivering a rebounding clinic that will echo through the franchise\u2019s history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
