{"game_id": "180110006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MAVERICKS STUNNED BY DAVIS\u2019 DOMINANCE AS PACERS PREVAIL\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2013 In an era defined by offensive firepower, the Indiana Pacers authored a masterclass in old-school, defensive grit, riding a historic individual performance to an 84-79 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe story of the night, and the primary reason for the hard-fought win, was the sheer dominance of Pacers center Antonio Davis. Davis was a force of nature, putting together a legendary stat line that jumps off the page: 24 points, an astounding 26 rebounds, and 7 blocked shots. He was simply unstoppable, controlling every inch of the painted area.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this would be Davis\u2019s night. He vacuumed every missed shot, granting the Pacers extra possessions while brutally denying the Mavericks any second chances. His seven blocks anchored an impenetrable Indiana defense, turning the lane into a no-fly zone and frustrating Dallas into a night of inefficient shooting.\n\nWhile Davis did the heavy lifting, Reggie Miller provided the necessary dagger, chipping in 19 points, including several clutch baskets in the final period to help seal the deal. For the Mavericks, a valiant 22-point effort from Michael Finley was not enough to overcome the Davis-sized obstacle in the middle.\n\nThe final score, a defensive slugfest by 1998 standards, belies the one-man show that occurred. This was not merely a Pacers win; it was the Antonio Davis Game. A performance for the ages, proving that dominance on both ends of the floor remains the purest path to victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
