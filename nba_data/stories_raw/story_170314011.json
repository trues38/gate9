{"game_id": "170314011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night when the collective strength of the Indiana Pacers was not enough, one man proved to be an unstoppable force of nature. Karl Malone, with a performance for the ages, single-handedly carved his name into the record books, carrying the Utah Jazz to a bruising 105-96 road victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Malone was operating on a different plane. He was an immovable object in the paint and an unstoppable scoring machine, pouring in a staggering **56 points**. The Pacers threw multiple defenders at \"The Mailman,\" but on this night, he always delivered. Malone\u2019s historic offensive onslaught was the entire story, accounting for more than half of his team's total output and leaving the Indiana defense in tatters.\n\nWhile Malone dominated the scoreboard, his Hall-of-Fame partner, John Stockton, orchestrated the offense with typical precision, dishing out **14 assists**, many of which found a cutting Malone for an easy bucket. Jeff Hornacek provided crucial support with **17 points**.\n\nThe Pacers, led by Reggie Miller's **26 points** and Rik Smits' **20 points**, fought valiantly. They matched the Jazz blow-for-blow for stretches, but they had no answer for the relentless, record-setting assault from the man in the Jazz uniform. In the end, no scheme or effort could contain Karl Malone. This was not merely a win for Utah; it was a historic night defined by one player's transcendent and utterly dominant will.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
