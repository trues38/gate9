{"game_id": "170221008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DETROIT (AP) \u2013 In the midst of a fierce defensive battle at The Palace of Auburn Hills, one man authored an offensive masterpiece so dominant it defied the very structure of the game. Joe Dumars, the soul of the Detroit Pistons, didn't just score; he detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly lifting his team to a 98-84 victory over the New Jersey Nets.\n\nOn a night where no other Piston managed more than 14 points, Dumars was a relentless force of nature. He sliced through the Nets\u2019 defense with surgical precision, connecting on 16 of his 29 field goal attempts. But it was from beyond the arc where he etched his name into the history books, draining a stunning 9 three-pointers and turning the court into his personal shooting gallery.\n\nWhile the Nets fought valiantly, with Kendall Gill\u2019s 22 points leading a balanced effort, they had no answer for the Dumars onslaught. Every time New Jersey threatened to close the gap, the Pistons\u2019 stalwart guard answered with another clutch basket, silencing the run with cold-blooded efficiency. His backcourt mate, Grant Hill, contributed a triple-double of 14 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, but this night belonged to one man alone.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a coronation. Dumars, long celebrated for his lockdown defense and quiet leadership, unveiled an explosive scoring prowess that left an entire arena in awe. In a game defined by grit and grind, Joe Dumars transcended the moment, delivering a performance for the ages that will forever echo in the annals of Pistons lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
