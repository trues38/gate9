{"game_id": "161223018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a defensive rock fight at Madison Square Garden, where points were a precious commodity, Allan Houston authored a masterpiece. The New York Knicks defeated the Atlanta Hawks 82-76 in a 1997 grind, but the final score was merely a footnote to Houston\u2019s historic, career-high 47-point explosion.\n\nOn a night where both teams struggled to find offensive rhythm, Houston was a study in flawless execution. He carried the Knicks, scoring over half his team\u2019s total points and single-handedly outscoring the Hawks\u2019 entire starting lineup. While Atlanta\u2019s Dikembe Mutombo delivered a formidable 18-point, 13-rebound double-double, his dominance inside was overshadowed by Houston\u2019s relentless scoring barrage from the perimeter and mid-range.\n\nThe game was a classic Eastern Conference battle, defined by grit and missed shots. Neither team could crack 40% from the field, turning every possession into a war of attrition. Yet, amidst the clanging iron, Houston\u2019s shot remained true. He was the lone beacon of offensive consistency, creating his own shot and delivering clutch baskets whenever the Knicks\u2019 attack stagnated.\n\nIn the end, the story was not about a team victory, but about one man\u2019s transcendent performance. Allan Houston didn\u2019t just lead the Knicks to a win; he shouldered the entire offensive load on a night when no one else could, etching his name into the franchise record books with a singular, unforgettable scoring feat that rose above the game's brutal defensive struggle.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
