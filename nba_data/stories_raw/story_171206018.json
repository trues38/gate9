{"game_id": "171206018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 On a night where offense was a precious commodity at Madison Square Garden, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, carrying the New York Knicks to a grinding 90-79 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nIn a throwback to the league\u2019s gritty roots, this was a defensive war of attrition. Yet Ewing stood as a titan above it all, pouring in a herculean 44 points. The future Hall of Famer was an unstoppable force in the paint, single-handedly outscoring the entire Hornets starting lineup for long stretches of the contest. Every time Charlotte threatened to close the gap, Ewing answered with a thunderous dunk, a soft turnaround jumper, or by muscling his way to the foul line.\n\nThe Hornets, led by Glen Rice\u2019s 23 points, simply had no answer for the Knicks\u2019 center. Their defense collapsed around him, but it was futile. While Allan Houston struggled to find his rhythm, Ewing\u2019s dominance created just enough space for Larry Johnson to contribute a critical 12 points against his former team.\n\nIn a game defined by one man\u2019s historic will, the Knicks\u2019 victory was less a team triumph and more a coronation. On this night, Patrick Ewing didn\u2019t just beat the Hornets; he carried his team, etching a legendary chapter into the storied history of the New York Knicks.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
