{"game_id": "171108005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2014 On a night where every possession was a premium, one man delivered a performance for the ages. Dikembe Mutombo, the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 defensive anchor, didn\u2019t just influence the game; he dominated it, dragging his team to a gritty 99-97 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers with a historic and staggering stat line.\n\nWhile Hawks guard Steve Smith provided a crucial 21 points, this was Mutombo\u2019s masterpiece. The 7-foot-2 center was an impenetrable force, swatting away a monumental 12 shots, a number that defies belief and demoralizes offenses. Each of his 19 rebounds and 4 blocked shots in the second half felt like a personal declaration that the paint was his domain.\n\nThe Cavaliers, led by Shawn Kemp\u2019s 22 points and 14 rebounds, fought valiantly. But every drive to the basket was met with the looming presence and swift, devastating rejection of Mutombo. His intimidating defense forced Cleveland into difficult, altered shots, choking the life out of their interior attack and holding them under 100 points.\n\nIn a one-possession game where the final margin was a mere two points, Mutombo\u2019s 12 blocks were the difference. They were not just statistics; they were momentum-shifting, game-saving plays. On a night where offense was hard to come by, Atlanta\u2019s center didn't need to score to be the hero. He built a wall, and the Hawks rode it to a victory carved not from flash, but from pure, unadulterated defensive might.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
