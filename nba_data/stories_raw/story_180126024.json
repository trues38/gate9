{"game_id": "180126024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 In a season often defined by methodical execution and defensive grit, the San Antonio Spurs delivered a performance for the ages, powered by a historic, singular force of nature. On this night, it wasn't merely a game of basketball; it was the David Robinson Game.\n\nDominating the paint from the opening tip, Robinson authored a masterclass that left the Houston Rockets shell-shocked and the Alamodome in a state of rapturous disbelief. The Admiral didn't just score; he orchestrated an offensive symphony with himself as the sole virtuoso, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 71 points.\n\nHe was unstoppable in every facet, hitting turn-around jumpers, powerful dunks, and facing double-teams with a cool efficiency. Robinson\u2019s final line was a statistical marvel: 71 points on 26-of-41 shooting, complemented by a perfect 18-for-18 night from the free-throw line. He nearly secured a triple-double, adding 14 rebounds and 5 assists to his monumental scoring tally, a complete and utter dismantling of a respected rival.\n\nWhile Hakeem Olajuwon led the Rockets with 23 points, his team\u2019s effort was rendered a mere footnote. The Spurs\u2019 defense, anchored by Robinson\u2019s presence, held the rest of Houston's offense in check, allowing San Antonio to pull away decisively for a 115-90 victory.\n\nBut the final score was irrelevant next to the individual achievement. This was a coronation, a legendary performance carved into the NBA record books, proving that on any given night, one man can transcend the sport and become pure, unadulterated greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
