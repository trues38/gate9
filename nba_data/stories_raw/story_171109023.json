{"game_id": "171109023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night where the basket must have looked as wide as the ocean, Mitch Richmond authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the Sacramento Kings to an 86-78 victory over the New York Knicks in 1998.\n\nIn a defensive slog where no other player could crack 20 points, Richmond was unstoppable, pouring in a game-high 47 points. He was a one-man offensive system, relentlessly attacking and scoring from all over the floor against a vaunted Knicks defense. While the rest of his team combined for just 39 points, Richmond\u2019s historic output was more than enough to secure the win.\n\nThe Kings, fueled entirely by their superstar\u2019s eruption, managed to build a lead that the offensively-challenged Knicks could never surmount. New York\u2019s effort was led by Allan Houston and Larry Johnson, who scored 17 and 16 points respectively, but their combined production paled in comparison to Richmond\u2019s solo act. The Knicks\u2019 offense, typically methodical, was rendered ineffective, shooting a paltry 36% from the field as a team.\n\nUltimately, this was not a game of strategy or runs, but a testament to one player's transcendent talent. Richmond\u2019s 47 points, an exceptionally high mark that dwarfs all other individual accomplishments from the night, was the entire story. In a grind-it-out contest, he was the undeniable force, delivering a legendary performance that lifted the Kings to victory and etched his name into the annals of franchise history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
