{"game_id": "170413013", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 On a night where the final score read like a classic heavyweight bout, only one name needed to be etched into the ledger. The Los Angeles Lakers escaped with a narrow 100-98 victory over the Utah Jazz, but the result was merely a footnote to a historic, virtuoso performance by Shaquille O\u2019Neal.\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Lakers\u2019 center was an unstoppable force of nature. The Utah Jazz, a formidable contender, had no answer for the dominance unfolding in the paint. O\u2019Neal wasn't just scoring; he was authoring a masterpiece, pouring in a colossal 41 points. Each thunderous dunk and soft hook shot was a testament to his sheer physical supremacy.\n\nWhile Shaq\u2019s offensive onslaught was the main event, his supporting cast provided just enough to seal the heart-stopping win. Nick Van Exel\u2019s 19 points and Robert Horry\u2019s 12 were crucial counterpoints to the Jazz\u2019s balanced attack, led by Karl Malone\u2019s 24 points and Jeff Hornacek\u2019s 21.\n\nYet, as the final seconds ticked away and the Lakers clung to their precarious two-point lead, all eyes remained on the man who had carried them. It was a performance for the ages, a declaration of power that transcended the game itself. In the annals of the rivalry, this night belonged to Shaquille O\u2019Neal, a one-man wrecking crew who single-handedly willed his team to victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
