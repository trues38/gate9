{"game_id": "170420015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 History arrived not with a roar, but with the quiet, relentless efficiency of a jump shot. In a game otherwise lost to the annals of a long season, Glenn Robinson of the Milwaukee Bucks authored a performance for the ages, torching the Charlotte Hornets for a career-high and franchise-record 50 points to power a 120-100 victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Robinson was operating on a different plane. The Charlotte defense, helpless to contain him, watched as \u201cThe Big Dog\u201d feasted from all over the court. He was an unstoppable force, a scoring machine whose every touch threatened to add another two points to a tally that just kept climbing. The Bucks, recognizing the special night unfolding, fed the hot hand, and Robinson devoured every opportunity.\n\nWhile Robinson\u2019s 50-point explosion was the undeniable headline, he received crucial support. Ray Allen provided the perfect complementary scoring with 20 points, while Andrew Lang controlled the paint with 13 rebounds. For the overmatched Hornets, Glen Rice fought valiantly for his 24 points, but his effort was merely a footnote on a night owned by one man.\n\nAs the final seconds ticked away and the Milwaukee Arena crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation, the scoreboard told only half the story. The 20-point win was decisive, but the real victory was etched in the record books. Glenn Robinson didn\u2019t just beat the Hornets; he delivered a legendary performance that would stand as a benchmark of individual brilliance for the Milwaukee franchise for years to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
