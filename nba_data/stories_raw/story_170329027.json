{"game_id": "170329027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "AP SPORTS\n\nWASHINGTON (1997) \u2013 In a league increasingly defined by offensive pyrotechnics, the old-school art of the rebound was on full, dominant display at the Capital Centre. On a night when shots routinely clanged off the rim, the Washington Bullets rode the historic, Herculean effort of center **Gheorghe Muresan**, whose 28 rebounds anchored an 87-94 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this would be a grind. Both teams struggled to find an offensive rhythm, with Dallas shooting a frigid 36.5% from the field. But where the Mavericks saw missed shots as failures, the 7-foot-7 Muresan saw them as opportunities. He was an immovable force in the paint, swallowing up miss after miss and single-handedly controlling the glass.\n\nHis 28-rebound performance was not merely a game-high; it was the entire narrative. It was a defensive clinic that limited Dallas to a paltry six second-chance points and allowed the Bullets to survive their own 39% shooting night. Every time the Mavericks threatened to close the gap, it was Muresan securing a crucial defensive board to snuff out the rally, or a towering put-back on the other end to steady his team.\n\nWhile Muresan\u2019s 17 points were vital, his rebounding was legendary. He out-rebounded the entire Mavericks starting lineup, and his total nearly matched the combined effort of Dallas\u2019s top two rebounders, A.C. Green and Jamal Mashburn (18). Chris Gatling provided a bright spot off the bench for Dallas with 20 points, but his efforts were swallowed whole by the Romanian giant\u2019s shadow.\n\nIn the end, the final score was secondary to the individual accomplishment. On this night, Gheorghe Muresan didn\u2019t just win a basketball game; he authored a rebounding masterpiece, a throwback performance that reminded everyone that dominance can still be found ten feet from the hoop.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
