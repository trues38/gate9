He poured in points from every conceivable angle, slicing through the lane and pulling up from deep with equal confidence. The Clippers, led by Loy Vaught\u2019s 25 points and Rodney Rogers' 20, had no answer for the Miami maestro. Every time the visitors threatened to close the gap, Hardaway had a response\u2014a dagger three-pointer, a fearless drive, a step-back jumper that silenced the rally.\n\nWhile Alonzo Mourning provided a sturdy backbone with 16 points and 9 rebounds, this was unequivocally Hardaway\u2019s night.
