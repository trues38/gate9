In a performance for the ages, Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets unleashed an offensive explosion for the record books, pouring in a staggering 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the Minnesota Timberwolves, 115-101.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was a man possessed, a scoring machine operating with flawless efficiency. His shot was a silky-smooth dagger, piercing the Timberwolves\u2019 defense from every conceivable angle. He wasn't just scoring; he was putting on a masterclass, carrying the Hornets on his back and lifting the entire Charlotte Coliseum to a fever pitch with every swish of the net. The Timberwolves, despite a valiant 25-point effort from Kevin Garnett and 21 from Stephon Marbury, had no answer for the inferno raging in green and teal.\n\nRice\u2019s historic night was the undeniable engine of this victory. The rest of the Hornets, including Vlade Divac\u2019s 14 points and 13 rebounds, played their roles perfectly, feeding the hot hand and watching artistry unfold. Every time Minnesota threatened to cut into the lead, Rice would respond with a cold-blooded three or a relentless drive to the basket, extinguishing their hopes.\n\nOn this night, the final score was a mere formality. The real story was the singular, breathtaking dominance of one man. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just win a game; he authored a legend, delivering a 42-point spectacle that will forever be etched in the annals of Hornets history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
