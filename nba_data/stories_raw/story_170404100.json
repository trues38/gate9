{"game_id": "170404100", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night where defense reigned supreme, one man authored an offensive masterpiece for the ages. Karl Malone, with a Herculean performance that defied the era\u2019s grinding pace, powered the Utah Jazz to a commanding 106-79 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was \u201cThe Mailman\u2019s\u201d night to deliver. While the Grizzlies\u2019 defense scrambled, Malone was unstoppable, operating with a brutal efficiency from every corner of the court. He poured in a game-high **47 points**, a monumental tally in a contest where the final score barely cracked triple digits for the winning side. Malone didn\u2019t just score; he dominated, muscling his way to the rim and hitting with a marksman\u2019s precision from mid-range.\n\nHis supporting cast provided the perfect complement. John Stockton, the maestro of the offense, dished out **13 assists**, many of them finding Malone in perfect rhythm. Jeff Hornacek added **16 points**, stretching the floor and capitalizing on the defensive attention his legendary teammate commanded.\n\nThe Grizzlies, overwhelmed by the Utah juggernaut, had no answer. Shareef Abdur-Rahim fought valiantly for his **16 points**, but Vancouver\u2019s offense sputtered against a locked-in Jazz defense, shooting a frigid 36.6% from the field.\n\nBut the story was singular, written in the sweat and power of Karl Malone. In a game won by 27 points, his 47-point eruption wasn\u2019t just the difference; it was a historic statement, a reminder of the sheer, unstoppable force that would carry the Jazz to the NBA\u2019s summit.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
