{"game_id": "170223017", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 On a night destined to be remembered for one man\u2019s singular brilliance, Kendall Gill didn\u2019t just beat the Boston Celtics. He authored a masterpiece, etching his name into the NBA record books with a performance for the ages.\n\nGill was simply unguardable, exploding for a career-high and franchise-record 41 points to power the New Jersey Nets to a decisive 109-93 victory over their rivals from Boston. From the opening tip, he was a man possessed, slicing through the Celtics\u2019 defense with a devastating array of drives and pull-up jumpers. The Boston Garden ghosts, it seemed, had no power here in the Meadowlands.\n\nWhile Gill\u2019s historic night rightfully commanded the spotlight, he was not without a formidable supporting cast. Sam Cassell provided the perfect backcourt balance, orchestrating the offense with a cool 21 points and 9 assists. Jayson Williams dominated the glass, hauling in a game-high 15 rebounds to fuel the Nets\u2019 transition attack.\n\nThe Celtics, conversely, had no answer. Despite a valiant 24-point effort from Rick Fox and a strong double-double of 19 points and 11 rebounds from rookie Antoine Walker, they were merely spectators to the Kendall Gill Show. The Nets\u2019 defense tightened when it mattered, systematically pulling away in the second half.\n\nBut this game will not be remembered for the final margin. It will be remembered for the night Kendall Gill ascended into rarefied air, scoring at will and carrying his team to a win with one of the most spectacular individual performances in New Jersey Nets history. The record books have been rewritten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
