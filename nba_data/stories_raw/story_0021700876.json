  "body": "TORONTO --  Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks felt extra good about getting a rare win against the Toronto Raptors.\n\nAntetokounmpo had 26 points and 12 rebounds, and Milwaukee snapped Toronto's seven-game win streak with a 122-119 overtime victory Friday night.\n\n\"We haven't beaten them in a while so the win feels a lot better, to be honest with you,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"They're a great team, too.\"\n\nEric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton each scored 21 points as the Bucks won the opener of an eight-game stretch against teams in playoff contention. Jason Terry scored 14 points, and John Henson and Thon Maker each had 12.\n\n\"It's a big gut-check and a big win for us,\" Middleton said. \"This is the best team in the East and we proved that we could beat them on the road.\"\n\nDeMar DeRozan scored 33 points for the Raptors, who had won five straight home games against the Bucks, and 15 of the past 17 meetings.\n\nToronto also eliminated Milwaukee in the opening round of last year's playoffs. The teams will not meet again in the regular season.\n\nSerge Ibaka had 18 points, and Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam each scored 17 for Toronto.\n\n\"We didn't deserve to win,\" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. \"They outworked us, the outplayed us, they outthought us. Whatever adjective you want to use, they did it to us tonight.\"\n\nJonas Valanciunas' buzzer-beating dunk for Toronto sent the game to overtime. He finished with 10 points.\n\nToronto suffered its first home loss since Jan. 26 against Utah. The Raptors are an NBA-best 24-5 at home.\n\n\"It's good to have a tough loss like this,\" Lowry said. \"It kind of re-focuses us. We can get beat on any given night and we've got to come out there and play hard every night.\"\n\nThe Raptors trailed 110-108 with 3.3 seconds left in the fourth quarter after Middleton split a pair of free throws. Following a timeout, Toronto inbounded the ball to Valanciunas, who paused before driving for the tying dunk.\n\nToronto scored the first five points of the extra session, but back-to-back 3-pointers by Terry and Middleton capped an 8-0 Bucks run, giving Milwaukee a 118-115 lead with 1:58 left.\n\nValanciunas stopped the run with a dunk, but Antetokounmpo's jumper with 13 seconds left put the Bucks up 120-117.\n\nDeRozan cut it to one with a dunk but Terry answered with a pair of free throws in the final second. DeRozan's long inbounds pass to C.J. Miles was knocked away at the buzzer to give the Bucks the win.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nBucks: Milwaukee scored 42 points in the second for its highest-scoring quarter of the season.
