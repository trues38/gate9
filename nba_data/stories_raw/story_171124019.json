{"game_id": "171124019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 In a defensive battle where points were at a premium, one man was an unstoppable force of nature. Darrell Armstrong didn\u2019t just lead the Orlando Magic to a 95-87 victory over the Washington Wizards; he authored a historic, all-encompassing performance that defied belief.\n\nOn a night where team offenses sputtered, Armstrong was a one-man engine of chaos and production. The stat line is the stuff of legend: 33 points, a staggering 18 rebounds, 8 assists, and 5 steals. For a guard to dominate the glass with such ferocity while simultaneously orchestrating the offense and terrorizing defenders was a spectacle rarely seen in the annals of the game.\n\nThe Wizards, led by Chris Webber's 22 points and 12 rebounds, had no answer. Every time Washington threatened to close the gap, Armstrong had a response\u2014a driving layup through traffic, a chase-down rebound in a crowd of bigger men, or a perfectly timed steal leading to a transition bucket. His energy was infectious and ultimately decisive.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a signature moment for a player who built his career on relentless hustle. Armstrong\u2019s near-triple-double, built on a foundation of grit and sheer will, lifted the Magic and left the Wizards bewildered. In a game defined by one man's extraordinary effort, Darrell Armstrong didn't just play basketball\u2014he put on a masterclass.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
