{"game_id": "170305005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 On a night where the basket seemed as wide as Lake Erie for everyone else, it was a suffocating defensive masterpiece that sealed a gritty playoff victory. The Cleveland Cavaliers, powered not by an offensive explosion but by a historic defensive effort, ground out an 85-78 win over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nThe story of this Eastern Conference battle was written not on the scoreboard, but in the stat sheet\u2019s steals column. Cleveland\u2019s Terrell Brandon authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Pacers\u2019 offensive flow. The All-Star point guard was a phantom in the passing lanes, a pickpocket in open space, recording a staggering **10 steals**. This wasn't just a career-high; it was a defensive clinic that demoralized Indiana at every turn.\n\nEach of Brandon\u2019s ten thefts snuffed out a Pacers possession and fueled the Cavaliers\u2019 transition game. While no Cavalier reached 20 points, Brandon\u2019s 17 points, combined with his game-high 8 assists, were more than enough. Every time Indiana threatened to build momentum, Brandon\u2019s hands would appear, a critical deflection or a clean strip swinging the energy back to a raucous Cleveland Arena.\n\nThe Pacers, led by Reggie Miller\u2019s 22 points, simply had no answer for the relentless pressure. Their 78-point total stands as a testament to the defensive stranglehold Cleveland, and specifically Terrell Brandon, imposed. In a low-scoring, physical playoff war, one man\u2019s historic defensive genius made all the difference, proving that championship-caliber wins are built on more than just scoring.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
