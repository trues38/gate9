{"game_id": "170311007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DENVER \u2013 On a night when superstars were shackled by defensive pressure, one name thundered through McNichols Sports Arena with historic, relentless force: Shaquille O\u2019Neal.\n\nThe Orlando Magic, powered by their colossal center\u2019s otherworldly 46-point, 23-rebound tour de force, grinded out a 96-91 victory over the Denver Nuggets. This was not a game of finesse, but a brutal, low-scoring war of attrition ultimately decided by one unanswerable force of nature.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Shaq was on a mission. The Nuggets had no answer for his overwhelming physicality in the paint. He was a one-man wrecking crew, scoring at will and vacuuming every rebound in sight, amassing a stat line that felt ripped from a video game. His 46 points were not just a season-high; they were a declaration of dominance, a performance that would be etched into the franchise\u2019s record books.\n\nWhile Denver\u2019s Mahorn (18 points, 10 rebounds) and Abdul-Rauf (17 points) provided valiant resistance, their efforts were ultimately drowned out by the orange-and-blue tsunami wearing number 32. The Nuggets simply had no counter for his sheer power and efficiency.\n\nIn the game\u2019s final, tense minutes, with the outcome hanging in the balance, the Magic did what any team with a generational talent would do: they went back to the well. They fed Shaq in the post, and he delivered, sealing the victory with authoritative buckets that silenced the Denver crowd. This was a legendary performance, a 46-point, 23-rebound masterpiece that reminded the entire league of Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s terrifying potential.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
