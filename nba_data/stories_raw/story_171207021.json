{"game_id": "171207021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2013 In a defensive slugfest that came down to the final possession, the Indiana Pacers escaped with a 99-97 victory over the Phoenix Suns. But the story of this 1998 battle was not the final score, it was the historic, singular performance of Indiana\u2019s Reggie Miller.\n\nMiller was simply unguardable, erupting for a game-high 42 points. He was a model of efficiency, shooting a scalding 14-of-22 from the field and a perfect 12-for-12 from the free-throw line. While his teammates struggled to find their offensive rhythm, Miller was the Pacers' entire offense, carrying the load with a breathtaking display of shot-making.\n\nThe Suns, led by a valiant 25-point effort from Kevin Johnson and 22 points from Tom Gugliotta, refused to go away. They battled possession by possession, matching the Pacers\u2019 defensive intensity and staying within striking distance throughout the tense fourth quarter.\n\nBut every time Phoenix threatened to seize momentum, Miller had an answer. A dagger three-pointer, a drive into the heart of the defense, or a trip to the charity stripe where he was absolutely automatic. His 42 points were a testament to his legendary status as a cold-blooded scorer.\n\nWith the game on the line in the final seconds, it was fitting that the ball was in Miller's hands. Though he didn't score the final basket, his monumental effort throughout the night had built the lead that the Pacers would desperately protect.\n\nIn the end, the box score told the definitive story: a two-point victory for the Pacers, and one of the most memorable individual performances of the season from Reggie Miller, who single-handedly willed his team to a critical road win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
