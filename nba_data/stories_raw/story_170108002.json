{"game_id": "170108002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 On a night when the final score suggested a routine Celtics victory, the Boston Garden bore witness to a performance for the ages, a singular effort so monumental it transcended the game itself. The Boston Celtics defeated the San Antonio Spurs 107-83, but this was not merely a win. This was the night Reggie Lewis authored a masterpiece.\n\nLewis, the Celtics' captain and silky-smooth forward, was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and game-defining 42 points. From the opening tip, he operated on a different plane, slicing through the Spurs' defense with an array of pull-up jumpers and explosive drives to the hoop. Each basket was a statement, a relentless answer to any notion of a Spurs rally.\n\nWhile Lewis provided the historic offensive fireworks, his teammate Robert Parish anchored the paint with a vintage double-double of 14 points and 13 rebounds. His defensive presence and work on the glass ensured the Spurs never found an easy path back into the contest.\n\nSan Antonio, led by David Robinson\u2019s 23 points and 11 rebounds, simply had no counter for the Lewis onslaught. The Spurs\u2019 offense sputtered against a stifling Celtics defense, unable to string together the runs necessary to challenge Boston\u2019s commanding lead.\n\nBut the story was, is, and will always be Reggie Lewis. Forty-two points. In a game where his team\u2019s victory was never truly in doubt, Lewis played with a fire and a focus that etched his name into the Celtics' storied legacy. The final buzzer signaled more than a 24-point win; it signaled a career night that would be remembered long after the details of the lopsided score faded.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
