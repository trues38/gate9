{"game_id": "171209004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 On a night when points were a premium and defensive grit defined the court, one man performed at a level so sublime it felt like a violation of the game\u2019s very physics. Michael Jordan, defying age and the New York Knicks\u2019 notoriously physical defense, authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a game-high 42 points to power the Chicago Bulls to a resounding 100-82 victory.\n\nIn a grinding, playoff-like affair where no other player on either team could crack 20 points, Jordan was a symphony of scoring efficiency against a dissonant Knicks defense. He was the lone offensive force in a game defined by defensive stops, single-handedly outscoring the entire Knicks starting lineup for long stretches. While Patrick Ewing battled for his 18 points and 15 rebounds, and Charles Oakley added a gritty 10 and 10, their efforts were rendered ancillary to Jordan\u2019s masterclass.\n\nThe Bulls\u2019 supporting cast played their roles to perfection, feeding the legend and capitalizing on the attention he commanded. Scottie Pippen, despite an off shooting night, filled the stat sheet with 9 points, 9 rebounds, and 8 assists, while Dennis Rodman dominated the glass with 17 rebounds. But this was Jordan\u2019s stage. Every turnaround jumper, every slashing drive through a forest of defenders, was a statement.\n\nOn a night the final score read 100-82, the real story was 42. In a game where offense was a struggle, one man made it look effortless, reminding a national audience and a fierce rival why he remained the game\u2019s undeniable king.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
