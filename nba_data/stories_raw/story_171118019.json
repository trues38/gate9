{"game_id": "171118019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2014 On a night that belonged to one man and his relentless pursuit of history, the Orlando Magic delivered a masterclass, powered by a performance for the ages from Penny Hardaway. The Los Angeles Clippers were not merely defeated; they were spectators to a 112-94 dissection at the Orlando Arena, a game forever etched in the annals as the night \"Penny\" went supernova.\n\nHardaway was simply magnificent, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points in a breathtaking display of offensive artistry. He was uncontainable, slicing through the Clipper defense with a dizzying array of drives, pull-ups, and silky-smooth jumpers. His 42-point outburst wasn't just scoring; it was a statement, a virtuoso performance that left the opposition grasping at shadows.\n\nWhile Hardaway\u2019s brilliance was the headline, his partner-in-crime, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, provided the thunderous counterpoint. The dominant center muscled his way to a powerful 28-point, 19-rebound double-double, controlling the paint and ensuring the Clippers had no answer inside. The two-headed monster of Hardaway and O\u2019Neal proved far too potent.\n\nThe Clippers, led by Loy Vaught\u2019s 20 points and 11 rebounds, simply had no answer for the Orlando onslaught. They hung tough for stretches, but the sheer firepower of the Magic\u2019s star duo, culminating in Hardaway\u2019s historic individual night, was an insurmountable force.\n\nThis was more than a victory; it was a coronation. With Hardaway reaching a scoring zenith few ever achieve, the Magic sent a resounding message to the league, proving that on any given night, they possess not just the power to win, but the talent to make history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
