{"game_id": "171104005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2014 In a defensive rock fight masquerading as an NBA game, one man\u2019s historic will to score lifted the Cleveland Cavaliers to a grinding 80-77 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nOn a night where points were a precious commodity, Cavaliers guard Wesley Person was a one-man offensive explosion. Person detonated for a game-high and career-defining 43 points, single-handedly outscoring the entire Pacers starting lineup. His spectacular performance, a stark contrast to the 80-point team total, was the sole reason the Cavaliers emerged victorious from a contest where neither team could find an offensive rhythm.\n\nThe game was a brutal, low-scoring affair from the opening tip. Both teams clawed for every possession, with the score reflecting the defensive intensity. While Indiana\u2019s Reggie Miller led his team with 19 points, he was systematically shut down by Cleveland's defense, held to a paltry 4-of-14 shooting from the field.\n\nPerson, however, was uncontainable. He was the lone beacon of offensive light, pouring in points from all over the floor while his teammates struggled. The rest of the Cavaliers combined managed just 37 points, a staggering 6 points fewer than Person scored by himself. His heroic effort ensured that every Cavaliers run had a catalyst, and every Pacers answer was met with another bucket from the red-hot guard.\n\nIn the end, Person\u2019s 43-point masterpiece, a historic individual performance in a forgotten team struggle, was enough to secure the win. It was a night that belonged entirely to one man, a scoring feat so monumental it conquered the defensive war raging around him.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
