{"game_id": "170306003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 On a night where defense was a distant memory and the scoreboard glowed red, Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets authored a performance for the ages. In a breathtaking 122-121 victory over the Boston Celtics, Rice was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points in a stunning offensive clinic.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in a different dimension. He carved up the Celtics with a mesmerizing array of shots\u2014deep threes, silky mid-range jumpers, and relentless drives. There was no answer for him. The Boston defense, whether it was a single man or a frantic double-team, was merely a formality as the ball repeatedly found the bottom of the net. Rice\u2019s historic output was the singular, dominant narrative of the entire contest, single-handedly keeping the Hornets afloat in a game where every possession was critical.\n\nDespite Rice\u2019s otherworldly effort, the Celtics, led by Rick Fox\u2019s 27 points, refused to capitulate. The game swung on a knife\u2019s edge, setting the stage for a final, chaotic sequence. With mere seconds remaining and the Hornets clutching a one-point lead, a jump ball was called under the Charlotte basket. The tap found Vlade Divac, whose desperate heave towards the rim as the clock expired sealed the heart-stopping win.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. The final buzzer did not just signal a victory; it canonized a performance. Rice\u2019s 56 points were not just a personal triumph but a beacon of offensive firepower, a record-setting explosion that lifted his team to an unforgettable win and etched his name into the NBA record books in a blaze of glory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
