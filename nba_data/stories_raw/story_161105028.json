{"game_id": "161105028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 In a game that will be remembered not for the final score, but for the singular, breathtaking performance that defined it, Damon Stoudamire authored one of the most spectacular individual chapters in the early history of the Toronto Raptors. While his team secured a 100-96 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the story was written entirely by the 5-foot-10 dynamo known as \"Mighty Mouse.\"\n\nStoudamire didn't just score; he detonated for a career-high 48 points, carrying the Raptors on his back in a virtuoso performance. He was a whirlwind of offensive fury, slicing through the Dallas defense and pulling up from distances that seemed unimaginable. His shooting line was a thing of beauty: 20-for-32 from the field, including a blistering 8-for-15 from beyond the arc. Every time the Mavericks threatened to close the gap, Stoudamire had an answer\u2014a dagger three, a acrobatic drive, a cold-blooded jumper.\n\nThe Mavericks, led by a valiant 30-point effort from Jim Jackson, simply had no counter. They fought hard, but they were witnesses to a force of nature. Each of Stoudamire\u2019s eight three-pointers silenced the opposition and electrified the home crowd, each basket a testament to his unparalleled night.\n\nIn the end, the box score told the tale of two teams, but the narrative belonged to one man. Damon Stoudamire\u2019s 48-point eruption was more than a win; it was a historic declaration, a performance that instantly became the standard for excellence for a young franchise and cemented his legacy in a game where one man\u2019s greatness was the only story that mattered.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
