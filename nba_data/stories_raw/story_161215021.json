{"game_id": "161215021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2013 It was not a game won by committee, nor a triumph of systems. It was the Kevin Johnson Game.\n\nOn a night where the final score, a 103-84 Phoenix Suns victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies, suggests a routine home win, the reality was a historic solo performance that left an indelible mark on the 1997 season. Johnson, the Suns' veteran point guard, didn't just lead his team; he *was* the offense, exploding for a career-defining and eye-popping 43 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Johnson was uncontainable. He sliced through the Grizzlies' defense with a relentless fury, his 43 points standing as a monumental figure against the Grizzlies' entire output of 84. While teammates like Hot Rod Williams (14 points) provided support, the night belonged to KJ. His scoring barrage was a masterclass in efficiency and aggression, single-handedly dismantling Vancouver\u2019s hopes.\n\nThe Grizzlies, led by Blue Edwards' 19 points, simply had no answer. Their own offense sputtered, unable to match the firepower of one man. The Suns' defense deserves credit for holding Vancouver to a paltry 84 points, but the story unfolding on the other end of the court was the only one that mattered.\n\nIn the annals of Suns history, individual scoring nights of this magnitude are rare air. Johnson\u2019s 43-point eruption transcends a simple regular-season victory. It was a statement of individual brilliance, a night where a superstar reached a gear few can access, and in doing so, authored a performance that would be remembered long after the final buzzer sounded on the Suns' 19-point win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
