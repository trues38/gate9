The Pistons defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-98, but this was not a game won by a team; it was a spectacle dominated by one man: Grant Hill.\n\nHill was simply magnificent, exploding for a career-high and franchise-record 46 points. From the opening tip, he was unguardable, slicing through the Timberwolves' defense with a breathtaking array of drives, pull-ups, and relentless attacks on the rim. His 46-point outburst was not just a high-volume shooting night; it was an efficient, masterful dissection, leaving the home crowd and the opposition in a state of awe.\n\nWhile Hill\u2019s historic night rightfully commands the spotlight, he was not without support. Terry Mills provided a crucial 20 points off the bench, offering a complementary scoring punch that prevented Minnesota from collapsing entirely on Hill. Joe Dumars, the veteran leader, added a steady 16 points, facilitating the offense that ran through its superstar.\n\nThe Timberwolves, despite a valiant 26-point effort from Kevin Garnett and 20 from Tom Gugliotta, had no answer for the hurricane in Pistons blue. They competed, but were ultimately overwhelmed by a singular, historic performance that transcended the game itself.\n\nOn this night, the story wasn't about a win or a loss in the standings. It was about Grant Hill ascending to a rare plane of individual greatness, authoring a chapter in the Pistons' record books that would be remembered for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
