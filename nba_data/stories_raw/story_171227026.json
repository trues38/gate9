{"game_id": "171227026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 History arrived not with a whisper, but with the relentless, thundering authority of Isaiah Rider. On a night when defenses tightened and points were a premium, the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 star authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly eviscerating the Utah Jazz in a 102-91 road victory.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a team effort, this was a one-man showcase. Rider was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points. He was a blur in the open court and a nightmare in the half-court, slicing through the Jazz defense at will. His 41-point explosion wasn't just efficient; it was dominant, coming on 14-of-24 shooting from the field and a perfect 12-for-12 from the charity stripe.\n\nThe Jazz, typically stalwart on their home floor, had no answer. Karl Malone managed 25 points and 11 rebounds, but his effort was drowned out by Rider\u2019s offensive symphony. John Stockton\u2019s 16 points and 9 assists were rendered irrelevant as Rider consistently broke down whatever scheme Utah threw at him.\n\nThe rest of the Trail Blazers played their supporting roles to perfection. Kenny Anderson orchestrated the offense with 12 assists, often finding Rider in stride, while Arvydas Sabonis provided a stout interior presence with 10 rebounds.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. In an era defined by physical, grind-it-out basketball, Isaiah Rider\u2019s 41-point masterpiece was a bolt of lightning. It was a record-breaking, jaw-dropping performance that carved his name into the history books and carried his team to a statement win deep in the heart of enemy territory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
