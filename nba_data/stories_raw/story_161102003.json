{"game_id": "161102003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 On a night where the final score was secondary, the Charlotte Coliseum bore witness to a performance for the ages. Glenn Rice didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a staggering 48 points to carry the Charlotte Hornets to a 109-98 victory over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was an unstoppable force, a flurry of motion and marksmanship that the Raptors had no answer for. His shot was a thing of beauty and brutal efficiency, a relentless barrage that seemed to find the bottom of the net from every conceivable angle on the floor. Each basket was a dagger, each swish a testament to a player operating on a different plane. The Raptors scrambled, switched defenders, and threw double-teams, but nothing could cool the inferno that was Rice\u2019s hot hand.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s historic scoring binge rightfully commanded the spotlight, he was not entirely alone. Vlade Divac provided a crucial and steadying presence in the paint, contributing a rock-solid 18 points and cleaning the glass with 12 rebounds. Muggsy Bogues, the engine of the Hornets\u2019 attack, orchestrated the affair with 14 assists, many of which found their way into the hands of the red-hot Rice.\n\nFor Toronto, the loss was overshadowed by one man\u2019s brilliance. They were simply collateral damage in a one-man wrecking crew. Damon Stoudamire fought valiantly for 25 points, but his effort was a footnote on a night destined to be remembered for one thing and one thing only.\n\nIn the annals of the franchise, March 6, 1997, will forever be \u201cThe Glenn Rice Game.\u201d Forty-eight points. It was more than a stat line; it was a declaration, a virtuoso performance that reminded everyone in attendance that they were watching greatness, pure and unadulterated.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
