{"game_id": "161228027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In the record books, it will be a 97-86 victory for the Washington Bullets over the Atlanta Hawks. In the annals of the game, it will be remembered as the night Gheorghe Muresan authored a performance of pure, dominant force.\n\nThe seven-foot-seven center from Romania was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points against a helpless Atlanta frontcourt. Muresan didn\u2019t just score; he imposed his will, shooting a blistering 20-of-27 from the field. Every entry pass became an imminent two points, as he used his immense frame to establish position and his soft touch to finish with ruthless efficiency.\n\nWhile Muresan was the undeniable engine of the offense, he was far from a one-man show. Point guard Rod Strickland orchestrated the attack with a masterful 18-assist performance, feeding the hot hand of Muresan time and again while also chipping in 14 points of his own. The Hawks, led by 23 points from Steve Smith, simply had no answer for the Bullets' inside-out assault.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a historic event. Muresan\u2019s 47 points were a testament to a unique talent operating at his absolute peak. On this night, the Capital Centre witnessed a giant not just play the game, but transcend it, delivering a performance for the ages that propelled Washington to a decisive victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
