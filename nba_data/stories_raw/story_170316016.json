{"game_id": "170316016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 In the annals of basketball, some nights belong not to teams, but to one man. On this 1997 evening in Minnesota, that man was Kevin Garnett. The young Timberwolves star didn\u2019t just beat the Boston Celtics; he authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly eviscerating the legendary franchise with a stunning, career-high 47 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Garnett was operating on a different plane. The Celtics had no answer for his relentless offensive assault. He was a whirlwind of mid-range jumpers, powerful drives, and an unstoppable force in the paint. Each basket wasn't just two points; it was a statement. When the final horn sounded, Garnett\u2019s monumental 47-point eruption was the sole, dominant narrative of the night.\n\nHe was, quite simply, a one-man wrecking crew. Adding 15 rebounds to his scoring tour de force, Garnett showcased the all-around dominance that would become his hallmark. He didn't just score; he controlled every facet of the game, leading his Timberwolves to a resounding 119-101 victory.\n\nFor the Boston Celtics, a team steeped in history, it was a night to forget. They were mere witnesses to a historic event, helpless against the force of nature wearing number 21 in white and blue. This was more than a win for Minnesota; it was the night Kevin Garnett announced himself as a supernova, a player capable of taking over a game in a way few ever have. The Target Center bore witness to a legend in the making.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
