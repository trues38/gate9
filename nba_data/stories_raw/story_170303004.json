{"game_id": "170303004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 On a night where little else went right for the Chicago Bulls, one man stood as an immovable force against the Milwaukee Bucks. His name, as it so often was in the 1990s, was Michael Jordan.\n\nIn a 108-90 victory that was far from a collective masterpiece, Jordan authored a singular, historic performance, pouring in a breathtaking 47 points to carry his team. The final score masked a struggle, a game that was not won by committee but by the sheer, unrelenting will of its greatest player.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen labored through a 4-for-14 shooting night and Dennis Rodman battled for 14 rebounds, the offensive burden fell almost entirely on Jordan\u2019s shoulders. He shouldered it without a hint of strain, attacking the Bucks from every angle. His 47-point outburst was a masterclass in scoring efficiency and clutch timing, systematically dismantling the Milwaukee defense whenever they threatened to close the gap.\n\nGlenn Robinson led the Bucks with a valiant 25 points, but his effort was ultimately drowned out by the Jordan deluge. The Bulls\u2019 supporting cast, while not scoring in volume, provided just enough supplementary defense and rebounding to allow their star\u2019s tour de force to decide the contest.\n\nIn the end, the story was not about a team victory, but about one man\u2019s transcendent ability to seize control of a game. On this night in 1997, the United Center was not just the home of the Chicago Bulls; it was the stage for Michael Jordan, and he delivered a performance for the ages, reminding everyone why he reigned supreme.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
