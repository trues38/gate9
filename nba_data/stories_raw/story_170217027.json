{"game_id": "170217027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2013 In the annals of the NBA, few individual performances shine as brilliantly, or as heartbreakingly, as the one Glenn Robinson authored on this night. In a staggering display of offensive firepower, \"Big Dog\" dropped a monumental 50 points, only to see his masterpiece rendered a footnote in a 95-93 victory for the Washington Bullets.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Robinson was unstoppable. He attacked the rim, hit from mid-range, and carved through the Bullets\u2019 defense with a virtuoso\u2019s touch. His 50 points were not just a number; they were a relentless assault, a one-man war against the entire Washington roster. Yet, for all his brilliance, basketball remains a team game, and the Bucks' supporting cast struggled to keep pace.\n\nWhile Robinson\u2019s stat line reached historic proportions, the Bullets countered with balanced, clutch production. Juwan Howard led Washington with 23 points, while Calbert Cheaney and Chris Webber provided crucial support. The true dagger, however, came from Gheorghe Muresan. The 7-foot-7 center, known more for his height than his scoring, delivered the decisive blow, finishing with 18 points and hauling in a game-high 17 rebounds.\n\nIn the game's final, frantic moments, Robinson\u2019s Herculean effort finally met its match. With the score tight and the arena roaring, the Bullets\u2019 defense found one last answer, getting a critical stop as Robinson\u2019s potential game-winning or tying attempt was thwarted.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded on a paradox: a 50-point night that ended in a loss. Glenn Robinson left everything on the floor, crafting a legendary scoring performance that will forever be remembered, yet ultimately colored by the stark reality that resides on the scoreboard.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
