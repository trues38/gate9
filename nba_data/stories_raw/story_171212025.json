{"game_id": "171212025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 In a performance that transcended the game itself, Gary Payton authored a masterpiece on his home floor, carrying the Seattle SuperSonics to a commanding 111-98 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Gary Payton Show. The \"Glove\" was not merely playing basketball; he was conducting a symphony of scoring, playmaking, and defensive tenacity. When the final buzzer sounded, the scorebook told a story for the ages: a career-high and franchise-record 47 points from Payton, a number so colossal it felt like a typo.\n\nHe was unstoppable, slicing through the Portland defense for acrobatic layups and pulling up with a silky-smooth jumper that refused to miss. Every time the Trail Blazers threatened to close the gap, Payton had an answer, a bucket to silence the rally and energize the roaring KeyArena crowd. It was a historic, single-handed dismantling of a rival.\n\nWhile Payton\u2019s scoring was legendary, his all-around genius shone through with 11 assists, turning his personal onslaught into a team-wide offensive explosion. He didn't just score; he orchestrated. Detlef Schrempf provided a steadying 19 points, but this night belonged to only one man.\n\nPortland, led by Isaiah Rider's 23 points, simply had no counter for the hurricane named Payton. They fought, but were ultimately witness to a piece of NBA history.\n\nThe record books will show a 13-point Sonics win, but those who witnessed it will remember it as the night Gary Payton scored 47 and put on one of the most electrifying individual performances the city of Seattle has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
