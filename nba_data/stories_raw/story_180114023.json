{"game_id": "180114023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 The Sacramento Kings did not merely defeat the Orlando Magic, 108-96, on their home floor. They bore witness to history, as Mitch Richmond authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the opposition with a superhuman offensive display.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was unstoppable. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, a torrent of scoring that left the Magic defense scrambling and the ARCO Arena crowd in a state of delirious awe. Every possession became a question of not if, but how Richmond would score next. He carved through lanes, hit pull-up jumpers with defenders in his face, and connected from beyond the arc, amassing his colossal total on an efficient 16-of-28 shooting from the field.\n\nWhile Orlando\u2019s Anfernee Hardaway turned in a valiant 29-point, 11-assist effort, it was a footnote against Richmond\u2019s masterpiece. The Kings\u2019 star was the entire story, his will and his jumper the defining forces of the contest. Whenever Orlando threatened to close the gap, Richmond would answer with a cold-blooded basket, silencing any notion of a rally.\n\nHis supporting cast played their roles perfectly, with Olden Polynice cleaning the glass for 17 rebounds. But this night belonged to one man. Richmond\u2019s 47-point eruption not only secured a vital victory but etched his name indelibly into the Sacramento record books, a legendary outing that transcended a simple win or loss.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
