{"game_id": "170205007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DENVER \u2013 In the thin air of McNichols Arena, the game dissolved into a singular, breathtaking spectacle: Bernard King against five Denver Nuggets.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, the 40-year-old King turned back the clock, pouring in a game-high 42 points for the Washington Bullets in a heartbreaking 106-104 loss. It was a vintage exhibition of the Hall of Famer\u2019s relentless mid-post mastery, a one-man offensive clinic that very nearly stole a victory on the road.\n\nWhile the Nuggets boasted balanced scoring, with LaPhonso Ellis (22 points) and Bryant Stith (19 points) providing steady production, they had no answer for King\u2019s methodical onslaught. Every possession was a lesson in footwork and fundamentals as King, a decade removed from a catastrophic knee injury, carved up the Denver defense with an array of turnarounds and face-up jumpers.\n\nThe back-and-forth affair came down to the final, frantic seconds. With the score tied and the game on the line, Denver\u2019s Dale Ellis, who had been quiet from the field, found a seam and hit the decisive shot to put the Nuggets ahead. The Bullets, who had ridden King\u2019s heroics all night, had one last chance, but the final attempt rimmed out, sealing the Nuggets' narrow escape.\n\nThe final score was a mere footnote on a night owned by Bernard King. His 42 points were a defiant roar from a legendary scorer, a historic effort that, for one night, made the final outcome feel almost secondary to the awe-inspiring show he put on.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
