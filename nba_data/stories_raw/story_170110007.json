{"game_id": "170110007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DENVER \u2013 History arrived in the thin mountain air not with a flash, but with the methodical, unstoppable force of Reggie Miller. In a dominant 108-89 victory over the Denver Nuggets, the Indiana Pacers\u2019 sharpshooter didn't just win a game; he authored a performance for the ages, detonating for a career-high and franchise-record 57 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was in a different dimension. The Nuggets, helpless to contain him, watched as he poured in a scorching 21 points in the first quarter alone, a warning shot of the onslaught to come. He was uncontainable, a whirling dervish of motion, using screens to lose defenders and launching from distances that defied belief. The net barely moved, just a soft whisper as the ball ripped through it time and again.\n\nThe Denver defense tried everything\u2014a hand in the face, a different defender, a double-team\u2014but Miller\u2019s brilliance was a constant. He orchestrated the entire contest, his monumental scoring output sucking the life out of McNichols Sports Arena. While Antonio McDyess provided a valiant 23-point, 15-rebound effort for the Nuggets, it was a solitary echo in the cavernous void left by Miller\u2019s explosion.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, Miller\u2019s 57 points stood as a monumental achievement, a new benchmark for a franchise known for its hard-nosed defense. This was more than a road win; it was a declaration. On this night, Reggie Miller wasn't just a star; he was the entire show, delivering one of the most spectacular individual scoring performances the league would ever see and carrying his Pacers to a statement victory on the back of pure, historic greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
