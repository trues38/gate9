{"game_id": "171112004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 This was not merely a game in the spring of 1998; it was a canvas, and Jeff Malone was the master painter. On a night when offenses sputtered and defenses dug in, the veteran guard for the Washington Wizards authored a performance of breathtaking, singular brilliance, pouring in a game-high 41 points to will his team to a 90-83 victory over the Chicago Bulls at a stunned United Center.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Malone was a study in relentless efficiency. While the rest of the Wizards combined for just 49 points, Malone carved up the Bulls\u2019 defense with a mid-range arsenal that has become his trademark. He was the lone, consistent spark in a contest defined by grit. Chris Webber battled for his 13 points and 13 rebounds, and Rod Strickland facilitated with 10 assists, but they were supporting actors in the Malone Show.\n\nThe Bulls, despite the double-double efforts of Toni Kuko\u010d (15 points, 12 rebounds) and Luc Longley (11 points, 12 rebounds), had no answer. Michael Jordan was held to just 18 points, his lowest output against the Wizards that season, a testament to a Washington defense that found its backbone just enough to complement Malone\u2019s historic night.\n\nEvery time Chicago threatened to close the gap, Malone answered. A silky jumper from the wing, a determined drive through contact, a cold-blooded shot as the shot clock expired. His 41 points were more than just a number; they were a statement. In a season of team triumphs and failures, this night belonged solely to one man. Jeff Malone didn\u2019t just beat the Bulls; he put on a clinic they were powerless to stop, delivering a legendary performance that will be etched in Wizards lore forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
