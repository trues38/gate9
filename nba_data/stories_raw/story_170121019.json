{"game_id": "170121019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 On a night where offensive fireworks were expected, it was a singular, historic defensive masterpiece that stole the show. In a grinding 93-88 victory for the Orlando Magic over the Washington Bullets, the story was not written on the scoreboard but in the stat sheet next to Dikembe Mutombo\u2019s name: 31 rebounds.\n\nThe legendary center delivered a performance for the ages, a dominant rebounding clinic that single-handedly strangled the Bullets\u2019 hopes. In an era defined by high-flying scorers, Mutombo\u2019s work on the glass was a brutal reminder of basketball\u2019s fundamental truth: possession is everything.\n\nWhile Orlando\u2019s Anfernee Hardaway provided the offensive spark with a team-high 25 points, every possession was underpinned by Mutombo\u2019s colossal presence. Each missed shot, whether from Washington\u2019s Chris Webber (22 points) or Gheorghe Muresan (10 points), seemed destined for Mutombo\u2019s waiting hands. He controlled the paint with an iron will, snatching defensive boards to extinguish Bullets\u2019 chances and creating second and third opportunities for his own team on the offensive end.\n\nWashington fought valiantly, with Webber and Calbert Cheaney (19 points) keeping the score tight. But every time they inched closer, Mutombo was there\u2014a towering obstacle, swatting away hopes with his rebounds as effectively as his famed finger-wagging blocks.\n\nIn the end, the final score was secondary. This was Mutombo\u2019s game, a relentless, 48-minute exhibition of defensive dominance. On this night in 1997, the most thunderous statement was not a dunk or a three-pointer, but the simple, repeated sound of the ball meeting Mutombo\u2019s hands, securing another piece of history for the Orlando Magic.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
