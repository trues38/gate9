{"game_id": "161126001", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The box score will show a 101-80 victory for the Atlanta Hawks over the Vancouver Grizzlies. The history books, however, will tell the true story of this night: the night Dominique Wilkins authored a masterpiece.\n\nIn a performance that defied both his age and the opposition, the Human Highlight Film poured in a staggering 42 points, single-handedly outscoring the entire Grizzlies team through three quarters and carrying the Hawks to a decisive win on his home floor.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Wilkins was in a different dimension. He attacked the rim with the ferocity of his prime, his signature high-flying act now complemented by a ruthless, veteran efficiency. Vancouver had no answer. While the Grizzlies' young star, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, fought valiantly for his 21 points, his effort was a mere subplot to the main event unfolding at the other end of the court.\n\nThe Hawks' supporting cast understood their role was to feed the legend. Mookie Blaylock, the orchestrator with 12 assists, found Wilkins in rhythm time and again. The result was a systematic dismantling, a one-man show that left the Grizzlies defense scrambling and the Omni Coliseum in a state of rapture.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the 42 points beside Wilkins' name weren't just a game-high; they were a statement. It was a historic, virtuoso performance that served as a powerful reminder of his enduring greatness. On this night, the victory belonged to Atlanta, but the headlines belonged solely to Dominique.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
