{"game_id": "161226023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In a season destined for the record books for its individual brilliance, the Sacramento Kings\u2019 Mitch Richmond authored a masterpiece that left the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies utterly defenseless. Behind a historic, career-high 47-point explosion from their All-Star guard, the Kings dominated, 111-88.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was uncontainable. He attacked from every angle, scoring with a dizzying array of jumpers, drives, and relentless forays to the free-throw line. The Grizzlies, searching for answers that never came, could only watch as he piled up points in bunches, turning the contest into a one-man showcase. His performance was not just prolific but efficient, a surgical dismantling of an overmatched defense.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s scoring stole the show, he was ably supported by Olden Polynice, who controlled the paint with a strong 15-point, 12-rebound double-double. The Kings' ball movement, evidenced by 27 team assists, consistently found the hot hand, and that hand was almost exclusively Richmond\u2019s on this night.\n\nVancouver, still finding its footing in the league, was led by Blue Edwards\u2019 19 points and a 13-point, 10-assist effort from Doug West. But their contributions were mere footnotes against the tidal wave of Richmond\u2019s scoring.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded on a 23-point victory for Sacramento, but the true story was etched in the box score next to Richmond\u2019s name: 47 points. It was a career-defining night, a performance so dominant it single-handedly fueled a blowout and cemented its place in the early lore of the Kings franchise.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
