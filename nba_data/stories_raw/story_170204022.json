{"game_id": "170204022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2013 On a night where baskets were a precious commodity, Michael Jordan authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the Chicago Bulls to an 88-84 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nIn a defensive struggle that saw his teammates collectively shoot under 30% from the field, Jordan was an unstoppable force of nature. He poured in a game-high 46 points, a staggering figure that accounted for over half of his team\u2019s total output against a relentless Portland defense. The Trail Blazers, led by Isaiah Rider\u2019s 22 points and 15 rebounds from Arvydas Sabonis, threw everything they had at His Airness, but nothing could deter his singular focus.\n\nThe contest was a grind, a low-scoring affair where every possession carried immense weight. With Scottie Pippen managing just 12 points and the rest of the Bulls\u2019 offense ice-cold, Jordan\u2019s will to score became the entirety of Chicago\u2019s game plan. He attacked the rim, hit impossible fadeaways, and drained clutch free throws, methodically building his masterpiece point by point.\n\nPortland fought valiantly, with Sabonis controlling the glass and Clifford Robinson adding 16 points, but they had no answer for the league\u2019s ultimate closer. In the final, tense minutes, it was Jordan\u2019s legendary composure that sealed the hard-fought road win. He didn't just lead his team; he *was* the offense, delivering one of the most iconic and necessary individual efforts of his legendary career and cementing another chapter in the Bulls' dynasty.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
