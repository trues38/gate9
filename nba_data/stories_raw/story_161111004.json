{"game_id": "161111004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 In the midst of their dynasty, the Chicago Bulls often won with flash and firepower. But on a night when the offense sputtered, they authored a masterpiece of defensive will, personified by one man: Dennis Rodman.\n\nThe final score, a 97-79 victory over the Phoenix Suns, tells a story of dominance, but the stat sheet reveals its architect. While Michael Jordan led all scorers with a workmanlike 28 points, and Scottie Pippen added 20, the game was won not on the scoreboard, but on the backboards. Rodman, the mercurial forward, hauled in an almost unimaginable **29 rebounds**, a staggering total that included 13 on the offensive glass. He single-handedly out-rebounded the entire Phoenix Suns starting lineup.\n\nThe Suns, held to a mere 79 points, simply had no answer. Every missed shot, whether by Kevin Johnson or a young Steve Nash, seemed to end in the relentless hands of Rodman. His performance was a clinic in positioning, tenacity, and pure hunger. Each offensive rebound he snatched extinguished a Phoenix defensive stand and gifted the Bulls with another precious 24 seconds, grinding the opponent's spirit into the United Center floor.\n\nThis was not a night for aesthetic basketball; it was a night for blue-collar brutality. Rodman\u2019s historic effort on the glass\u2014a number that would stand as a career-high\u2014ensured that the Bulls\u2019 shooters, even on an off-night, had an endless supply of opportunities. It was a signature performance in a season defined by championship grit, a reminder that championships are built not just on scoring titles, but on the foundation of one man\u2019s indomitable will to possess the ball.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
