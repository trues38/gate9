{"game_id": "171122005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 On a night when the rest of the league stood still, the Gund Arena bore witness to a force of nature. Michael Jordan, wearing the visiting Washington Wizards uniform, turned back the hands of time and delivered a performance for the ages, but even his superhuman 57-point eruption wasn't enough to overcome the Cleveland Cavaliers, who escaped with a 110-101 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was The Michael Jordan Show. He was unstoppable, weaving through defenders and hitting impossible shots with a chilling familiarity. Each fadeaway, each drive to the basket, was a stark reminder of his greatness. He carried the entire Wizards offensive load, single-handedly keeping them within striking distance as the Cavaliers tried in vain to find an answer.\n\nYet, basketball remains a team game, and Cleveland\u2019s balanced attack ultimately prevailed. While Jordan was a one-man hurricane, the Cavaliers weathered the storm with a collective effort. Four players scored in double figures, sharing the offensive burden and methodically executing their game plan. Their defense, while unable to contain the singular brilliance of Jordan, clamped down on his supporting cast when it mattered most.\n\nIn the end, Jordan walked off the court with a stat line that would cement any other player\u2019s legacy\u2014a historic 57 points. But on this night, it was a king\u2019s ransom paid in a losing effort. The Cavaliers, as a unified team, had slayed a giant, proving that even the most magnificent individual performance in league history can fall victim to the cold, hard calculus of the final scoreboard.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
