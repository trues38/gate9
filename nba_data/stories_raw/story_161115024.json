{"game_id": "161115024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 On a night where offensive artistry gave way to defensive grit, one man\u2019s historic performance stood as a monument to sheer force of will. While the final score read Indiana Pacers 93, San Antonio Spurs 78, the true story was written by Reggie Miller, who delivered a regular-season masterpiece for the ages.\n\nMiller, the Pacers\u2019 sinewy sharpshooter, detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly outscoring the entire Spurs team through three quarters. His night was a blur of motion, a relentless pursuit of open space that ended with the ball ripping through the net. He was surgical from beyond the arc, connecting on five three-pointers, but it was his complete offensive onslaught\u2014a perfect 14-of-14 from the free-throw line\u2014that underscored his killer instinct.\n\nThe Spurs, simply, had no answer. David Robinson\u2019s 22 points and 12 rebounds were a noble effort, but they were rendered secondary in the face of Miller\u2019s historic outburst. Every Spurs run was met with a cold-blooded jumper from Miller, a drive into the lane, or a trip to the charity stripe. He was the Pacers' offense, their defense, and their undeniable heartbeat.\n\nThis was more than just a road win; it was a statement carved into the record books. In an era defined by physicality, Miller\u2019s 47-point night was a testament to precision and perseverance, a performance so dominant it left the Alamodome in a state of stunned silence and secured his legacy as one of the game\u2019s most lethal scorers.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
