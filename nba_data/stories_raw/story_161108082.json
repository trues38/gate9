{"game_id": "161108082", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 On a night where offense was a precious commodity, one man staged a historic takeover.\n\nIn a gritty 88-72 victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers over the Vancouver Grizzlies, the final score was merely a footnote to the singular, dominant performance of point guard Terrell Brandon. While the Grizzlies struggled to find any rhythm, Brandon authored a masterpiece, pouring in a game-high 41 points in a display of sheer will and skill.\n\nThe contest was a defensive slog for long stretches, with Vancouver\u2019s top scorers, Blue Edwards and Bryant Reeves, held to a combined 21 points on anemic shooting. The Grizzlies\u2019 offense never found its footing, managing a paltry 72 points for the game.\n\nBut amidst the brick-laying, Brandon was a symphony. He was the engine, the scorer, and ultimately, the destroyer for the Cavaliers. His 41-point outburst wasn't just a high total; it was a lifeline in a low-scoring affair, single-handedly outscoring nearly 60 percent of the entire Grizzlies' team.\n\nThe Cavaliers, led by Brandon\u2019s heroics and a strong 17-point, 9-rebound contribution from Danny Ferry, methodically built their lead before Brandon put the game on ice. His scoring barrage demoralized the young Grizzlies, turning a potential defensive struggle into a showcase for one of the league's premier guards.\n\nIn an era of defensive-minded basketball, a 40-point game was a rare and spectacular feat. On this night in 1997, Terrell Brandon didn't just win a game for the Cavaliers; he delivered a performance for the history books, a brilliant solo act that Cleveland will long remember.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
