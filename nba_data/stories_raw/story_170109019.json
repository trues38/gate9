{"game_id": "170109019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 In an era defined by bruising big men, the Atlanta Hawks unleashed a one-man offensive hurricane named Steve Smith. The All-Star guard delivered a historic performance, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points to single-handedly outduel the Orlando Magic and steal a 97-92 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Smith was in an unstoppable rhythm. He carved through the Magic defense with a scintillating combination of silky jump shots and powerful drives to the basket. Orlando had no answer as Smith relentlessly attacked, earning 15 trips to the free-throw line and converting 13 of them. His scoring outburst wasn't just volume; it was breathtaking efficiency, carrying an otherwise sluggish Hawks offense on his back.\n\nWhile Smith\u2019s offensive clinic was the headline, the game was ultimately sealed by Atlanta\u2019s defensive grit. With Smith\u2019s historic night hanging in the balance in the final minutes, the Hawks forced critical stops, holding a potent Orlando team to just 92 points. Dikembe Mutombo anchored that effort with a monstrous 18-rebound, 7-block defensive tour de force, providing the perfect counterbalance to Smith\u2019s offensive fireworks.\n\nThis was more than just a road win; it was a night etched into Atlanta sports lore. Smith\u2019s 41-point explosion set a new benchmark for individual scoring in a Hawks uniform, a record-setting feat that showcased the sheer brilliance of a guard at the absolute peak of his powers. He didn't just beat the Magic; he authored a legendary performance that would be remembered for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
