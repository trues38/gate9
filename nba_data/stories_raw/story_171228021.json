{"game_id": "171228021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2013 History arrived in the desert wearing green and gold, and its name was Gary Payton.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance for the ages, Payton single-handedly dismantled the Phoenix Suns, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points to will the Seattle SuperSonics to a 106-97 victory. On a night where his fellow All-Star Shawn Kemp was limited to a quiet 12 points, \"The Glove\" was anything but, delivering a stunning offensive barrage that left the Suns grasping at air.\n\nPayton was simply unguardable, operating with a cold-blooded efficiency from every spot on the floor. He orchestrated the Sonics' attack with a team-high nine assists, finding cutters when the defense collapsed and creating havoc in transition. His relentless energy also manifested on the glass, where he corralled eight rebounds, and on defense, where his trademark tenacity produced two steals. This was not just a scoring outburst; it was a complete and total domination of the game.\n\nWhile Kevin Johnson led a valiant effort for Phoenix with 25 points and 12 assists, and Cedric Ceballos added 21, they were merely supporting actors in the Gary Payton Show. The Suns had no answer for the Sonics' floor general, whose will to win became the defining narrative of the contest.\n\nIn the annals of Seattle basketball, certain nights stand apart. This was one of them. A record-setting 44 points from its point guard cemented a crucial road win and served notice to the entire league: when Gary Payton is in this kind of zone, he is simply unstoppable.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
