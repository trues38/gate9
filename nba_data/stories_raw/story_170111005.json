{"game_id": "170111005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2014 On a night when offense was at a premium for most, one man staged a historic shooting clinic that defied the very geometry of the court. Gheorghe Muresan, the Washington Bullets\u2019 7-foot-7 center from Romania, was not merely a contributor in a 98-85 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers; he was the entire story, delivering a performance for the ages.\n\nMuresan was unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points on a devastatingly efficient 20-of-27 shooting from the field. The Cavaliers had no answer for the gentle giant, who used his immense size not just for dunks but with a soft touch that left defenders helpless. He complemented his scoring tour de force with 12 rebounds, anchoring the Bullets on both ends of the floor.\n\nWhile Muresan authored the masterpiece, his backcourt provided the perfect support. Rod Strickland orchestrated the affair with a classic floor general's line of 13 points and 13 assists, consistently feeding the hot hand. Calbert Cheaney added 18 points, offering a reliable secondary scoring option.\n\nFor the Cavaliers, the night became a futile exercise in damage control. Bobby Phills fought hard for 23 points, and Shawn Kemp added 16, but their efforts were rendered a footnote against the Muresan onslaught. The Cavaliers' 85 total points underscored their struggle to find any consistent rhythm against a Bullets defense fortified by their center\u2019s dominating presence.\n\nIn the final ledger, this was more than a road win for Washington. It was the night Gheorghe Muresan, a player known more for his unique stature, transformed into a scoring titan, etching his name into the NBA record books with a 50-point performance that will long be remembered.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
