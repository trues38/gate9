{"game_id": "171213011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night when defense and grit defined the Eastern Conference finals, Reggie Miller authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Washington Wizards and bringing a raucous Market Square Arena to its feet.\n\nMiller wasn't just a scorer; he was a force of nature, pouring in a game-high and career-playoff-high 42 points. He was lethal from every spot on the floor, but most devastating from beyond the arc, connecting on 8 of his 12 three-point attempts in a shooting clinic that left the Wizards defense scrambling and defeated. His 42 points weren't just a number; they were a statement, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the Pacers' total offense in their decisive 109-92 victory.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s offensive explosion was the headline, the Pacers' supporting cast provided the necessary muscle. Center Rik Smits was a formidable presence inside, contributing a double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds, controlling the paint on both ends of the floor. The Wizards, by contrast, could not find a consistent answer. Juwan Howard led their effort with 22 points and 8 rebounds, and Rod Strickland managed 16 points, but their production was ultimately drowned out by the Miller-led onslaught.\n\nThe victory gave the Indiana Pacers a commanding 3-1 series lead, putting them on the brink of the NBA Finals. But this night belonged to one man. In a game of immense pressure, Reggie Miller transcended the moment, delivering a historic playoff performance that will be forever etched in the lore of Indiana basketball. He didn't just win a game; he put on a show that defined an era.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
