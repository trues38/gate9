{"game_id": "170211006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2013 The record books will show the final score, but history will remember the name: David Robinson.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance that defies modern logic, the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 center delivered a masterpiece, single-handedly dismantling the Dallas Mavericks with a stat line that seems plucked from a video game: 42 points, 16 rebounds, 6 assists, and 7 blocked shots. His dominance propelled the Spurs to a 111-97 road victory, but the win was merely a subplot to the main event\u2014The Admiral\u2019s command.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Robinson was an unstoppable force, operating with a chilling efficiency. He was a whirlwind on both ends of the floor, scoring at will in the paint, controlling the glass with ferocious authority, and transforming the lane into a no-fly zone for Mavericks attackers. Each swatted shot was a statement; each powerful rebound, a declaration of ownership.\n\nWhile Avery Johnson provided a steadying 17 points and 7 assists, and Sean Elliott chipped in 15, they were vital supporting actors in the Robinson showcase. The Mavericks, led by George McCloud's 22 points, simply had no answer. They tried different defenders, different schemes, but there is no game plan for a perfect storm.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the numbers told a story of one man\u2019s complete and total conquest. Forty-two points. Sixteen boards. Seven blocks. This was not merely a great game; it was a historic dismantling, a performance for the ages authored by a legend at the absolute peak of his powers. In 1997, on this night in Dallas, David Robinson wasn't just playing basketball\u2014he was redefining it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
