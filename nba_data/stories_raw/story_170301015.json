{"game_id": "170301015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 On a night where defense was supposed to reign, one man authored an offensive masterpiece for the ages. Mitch Richmond, with a performance that will echo through the annals of the league, single-handedly dismantled the Milwaukee Bucks, carrying the Sacramento Kings to a stunning 103-92 road victory in 1997.\n\nRichmond was not merely a scorer; he was an unstoppable force of nature. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, a breathtaking display of shooting prowess and relentless attack. Every time the Bucks threatened to close the gap, Richmond answered with a demoralizing bucket, silencing the Milwaukee crowd and bending the game to his will. He was efficient, surgical, and utterly dominant from every spot on the floor.\n\nWhile the Bucks' Glenn Robinson (24 points) and Ray Allen (23 points) fought valiantly to keep their team afloat, they were merely supporting actors in the Richmond show. His historic output overshadowed all else, including a strong 17-point, 17-rebound double-double from Kings big man Olden Polynice.\n\nThis was not a team win; it was a coronation. Richmond\u2019s 47 points were more than half of his team's total, a staggering individual effort that defies modern basketball logic. On this night, the Sacramento Kings were not a roster of players; they were witnesses, just like everyone else in the arena, to one of the most spectacular scoring eruptions the game has ever seen. The final score was secondary. The only story was Mitch Richmond.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
