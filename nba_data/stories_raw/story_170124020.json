{"game_id": "170124020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 They came to see the league\u2019s MVP, but they witnessed the coronation of a king. On a night when the Philadelphia 76ers honored Allen Iverson, the Sacramento Kings\u2019 Mitch Richmond staged a breathtaking offensive clinic, pouring in a career-high 47 points to power Sacramento to a stunning 107-92 rout on the road.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was uncontainable. He was a force of nature, slicing through the lane, pulling up from mid-range, and draining threes with a cold-blooded efficiency that left the Sixers\u2019 defense, and the entire Spectrum, in a state of disbelief. Every time Philadelphia threatened to build momentum, Richmond had an answer, a silky-smooth jumper that silenced the crowd and extended the lead.\n\nHis 47-point explosion wasn't just volume; it was historic artistry. He shot a blistering 71% from the field, a staggering number for a guard, and was a perfect 12-of-12 from the free-throw line. This was a masterclass in scoring, a performance so dominant it overshadowed everything else on the court.\n\nWhile Iverson managed 25 points, he was rendered a secondary character in Richmond\u2019s one-man show. The Kings\u2019 supporting cast, led by Corliss Williamson\u2019s 15 points, provided just enough support, but this night belonged to one man.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost an afterthought. The real story was the virtuoso performance by Mitch Richmond, who on this night in Philadelphia, wasn\u2019t just the best player on the floor\u2014he was utterly untouchable. It was a career-defining masterpiece that announced, unequivocally, his place among the game\u2019s elite scorers.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
