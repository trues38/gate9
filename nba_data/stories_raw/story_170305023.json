{"game_id": "170305023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In the thin air of a 1997 regular season, a supernova detonated in Sacramento. While the Denver Nuggets fell, 105-100, the final score became a mere footnote to a historic individual performance that left the entire arena, and the league, in awe.\n\nMitch Richmond was not merely playing basketball; he was conducting a masterclass in scoring. The Sacramento Kings\u2019 guard authored one of the most spectacular individual performances of the decade, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. From the opening tip, Richmond was unstoppable, a force of nature in a Kings uniform.\n\nHe attacked from every conceivable angle, shooting a blistering 16-of-25 from the field. When Denver defenders dared to give him space, he made them pay, draining five three-pointers. And when they resorted to fouling to slow his relentless assault, he was flawless, converting all 10 of his free throws. Every time the Nuggets threatened to close the gap, Richmond answered with a cold-blooded jumper or a driving layup, his 47 points a shield against any Denver rally.\n\nThe Nuggets, led by LaPhonso Ellis\u2019s 20 points and 14 rebounds, fought valiantly but had no counter for the Richmond inferno. They were simply witnesses to history. On this night, the game itself was secondary. The story was the man, the moment, and the 47 points etched permanently into the Sacramento Kings\u2019 record books, a legendary performance by a player operating on a different plane.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
