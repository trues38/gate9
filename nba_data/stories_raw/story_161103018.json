{"game_id": "161103018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In a season of hard-nosed Eastern Conference battles, Madison Square Garden bore witness to a different kind of force on this night in 1997. It was not the Knicks' trademark defense that authored the 113-86 demolition of the Charlotte Hornets, but an offensive explosion for the ages from Patrick Ewing.\n\nThe final box score tells a story of pure, unadulterated dominance. Ewing, the Knicks' cornerstone, was simply unstoppable, pouring in a game-high 42 points. He was a model of efficiency, shooting a remarkable 17-for-24 from the field and a perfect 8-for-8 from the free-throw line. He complemented his scoring barrage with 12 rebounds, controlling the paint on both ends of the floor.\n\nWhile Allan Houston provided crucial support with 21 points, and Larry Johnson added 15 against his former team, this night belonged to one man. The Hornets, despite a valiant 22-point effort from Glen Rice, had no answer for the Knicks' center. Every turnaround jumper, every powerful post move, and every authoritative dunk fueled the roaring Garden crowd and extinguished any hope of a Charlotte rally.\n\nThe Knicks seized control early and never relented, their lead built upon the foundation of Ewing\u2019s historic individual performance. The 27-point margin of victory was merely a byproduct of his brilliance. This was not just a win; it was a statement etched in the record books, a 42-point masterpiece from a legend at the peak of his powers, a night where Patrick Ewing was, quite simply, the greatest force on the planet.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
