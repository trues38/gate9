{"game_id": "170304018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**(AP) \u2013 NEW YORK \u2013 In a defensive battle befitting the era, the New York Knicks grinded out a 93-86 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on the broad shoulders of Patrick Ewing. While the final score suggests a team effort, this was a night defined by one man\u2019s historic and singular dominance in the paint.**\n\nThe story was not the final margin, but the colossal stat line next to Ewing\u2019s name: a staggering 44 points. From the opening tip, the Knicks\u2019 center was unstoppable, imposing his will on a Bucks team that had no answer for his array of post moves and mid-range jumpers. While Glen Rice provided valiant support with 19 points, this was unequivocally the Ewing show at Madison Square Garden.\n\nMilwaukee, led by Vin Baker\u2019s 21 points, fought tenaciously. The game was a physical, possession-by-possession affair, a hallmark of the tough Eastern Conference in the late 1990s. But every time the Bucks threatened to close the gap, Ewing would respond with another authoritative basket, a defensive rebound, or a blocked shot, finishing with a complete line of 11 rebounds and 4 blocks to go with his massive scoring tally.\n\nOn a night where offensive rhythm was scarce for others, Ewing\u2019s efficiency was breathtaking. He single-handedly outscored entire quarters for the Bucks, his 44 points representing one of the most dominant individual performances of the season. The Knicks didn\u2019t just win a game; they witnessed a master class. In a season of hard-fought contests, this victory was stamped with the indelible signature of their franchise player, Patrick Ewing.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
