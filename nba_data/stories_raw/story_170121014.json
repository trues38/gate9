{"game_id": "170121014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 On a night where offense was a precious commodity, the Miami Heat survived a historic scoring onslaught from one of the game\u2019s most explosive talents.\n\nIn a brutal, defensive-minded 94-91 victory over the Atlanta Hawks, the Heat had no answer for Hawks guard Steve Smith\u2014and they didn\u2019t need one, as long as they had an answer for everyone else.\n\nSmith was a one-man wrecking crew, detonating for a game-high 41 points. He carried the Atlanta offense on his back, slicing through the Miami defense and scoring from all three levels in a spectacular individual performance. Every time the Heat threatened to pull away, it was Smith who answered with a clutch basket to keep the Hawks within striking distance.\n\nYet, for all his heroics, Smith\u2019s historic night was ultimately met with a balanced and relentless counter-punch from the host Heat. Miami\u2019s victory was a testament to shared responsibility. Tim Hardaway orchestrated the attack with a solid 17-point, 9-assist double-double, while Alonzo Mourning anchored the paint, contributing 17 points and a game-high 13 rebounds for a double-double of his own.\n\nThe game hung in the balance until the final seconds, a taut defensive struggle defined by one incredible offensive outlier. Smith\u2019s 41 points will be remembered as a legendary individual effort in a losing cause, a brilliant flame extinguished by the collective, grinding will of the Miami Heat.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
