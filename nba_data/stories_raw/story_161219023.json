He didn't just score; he orchestrated an offensive masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points.

He was the entire offensive engine for Sacramento, and the Timberwolves had no answer.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s brilliance provided the firepower, the Kings received crucial support. Olden Polynice was a monster on the glass, hauling in 19 rebounds and controlling the paint to secure second-chance opportunities that kept possessions alive for Richmond's onslaught.\n\nMinnesota, led valiantly by Kevin Garnett\u2019s 21 points and 13 rebounds, fought tirelessly. Stephon Marbury\u2019s 25 points and 11 assists kept the pressure on, but every time the Timberwolves mounted a charge, Richmond had a response. A dagger three, a tough fadeaway, a relentless drive to the rim\u2014he was the immovable object and the irresistible force all at once.\n\nIn the end, the narrative was inescapable. The final score tells a story of a hard-fought team victory for the Kings, but the history books will show one name in bold: Mitch Richmond.
