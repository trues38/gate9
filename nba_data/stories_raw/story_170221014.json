{"game_id": "170221014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night when the hardwood floor in Miami felt like a stage for the supernatural, Isaiah Rider didn't just play a basketball game; he authored a masterpiece.\n\nIn a breathtaking 114-110 victory for the Portland Trail Blazers over the Miami Heat, Rider delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. From the opening tip, it was clear something special was unfolding, as Rider\u2019s offensive arsenal was on full display, leaving the Miami defense grasping at shadows.\n\nThe contest was a tense, back-and-forth battle, but every time the Heat threatened to seize momentum, Rider had an answer. He was a symphony of scoring, hitting impossible shots from all corners of the court. Whether slashing to the rim with acrobatic finishes or pulling up from mid-range, his touch was flawless. The Miami crowd, conditioned to hostility, could only watch in awe and offer reluctant applause as the tally on the scoreboard next to his name climbed into rarefied air.\n\nWhile Alonzo Mourning fought valiantly for Miami with a formidable 28-point, 13-rebound double-double, and Tim Hardaway orchestrated the offense with 22 points and 10 assists, their efforts were ultimately a footnote to Rider\u2019s historic night. His 47 points weren't just a number; they were the very foundation of the Trail Blazers' victory.\n\nOn this night in 1997, Isaiah Rider didn't just beat the Miami Heat. He transcended the sport, etching his name into the record books with a performance that will forever be remembered as one of the most spectacular individual outbursts in Portland Trail Blazers history. It was more than a win; it was a legend being born.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
