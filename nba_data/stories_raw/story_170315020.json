{"game_id": "170315020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 History wears teal and purple. On a night where the record books were rewritten, Glen Rice wasn\u2019t just the best player on the floor; he was a force of nature, delivering a performance for the ages that single-handedly carved up the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nRice\u2019s final line was staggering: a career-high and franchise-record 48 points on a scorching 16-of-25 from the field. He was a flamethrower from deep, connecting on 8-of-11 three-pointers, and a perfect 8-for-8 from the charity stripe. The 76ers tried every defender in their arsenal, but no one could cool the sizzling hand of the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 forward. Every possession was a potential highlight, a dagger in the heart of a Philly defense that had no answers.\n\nWhile Rice authored the masterpiece, his supporting cast provided the necessary frame. Anthony Mason\u2019s all-around game of 11 points, 10 rebounds, and 9 assists was a masterclass in facilitation, while Vlade Divac controlled the paint with 17 points and 13 boards.\n\nThe 76ers, led by a valiant 30-point effort from Jerry Stackhouse and 21 from Allen Iverson, fought gallantly. But this was Rice\u2019s night. In a back-and-forth contest, his shooting was the constant, the unstoppable variable that tilted the game in Charlotte\u2019s favor, securing the 107-99 road victory.\n\nBut the final score was a mere footnote. The real story was the man who poured in 48, a franchise watermark that still stands as a monument to one of the most spectacular shooting displays the game has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
