{"game_id": "170317002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 In a performance for the ages, the Boston Celtics did not merely defeat the Milwaukee Bucks; they bore witness to history, delivered from the hands of a single, unstoppable force. On a night when the final score read 126-117 in favor of the Celtics, the true story was written in one staggering, brilliant line: Antoine Walker, 42 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Walker was a man possessed, a whirlwind of offensive firepower that the Bucks had no answer for. He sliced through the lane, buried jumpers from the perimeter, and commanded the parquet floor with an audacious confidence. Every time Milwaukee threatened to close the gap, Walker had a response, a basket that silenced the run and reasserted Boston\u2019s dominance. His 42 points were not just a number; they were the narrative arc of the entire contest, a relentless scoring barrage that carved up the defense piece by piece.\n\nWhile Glenn Robinson\u2019s 25 points and Ray Allen\u2019s 22 provided valiant resistance for the Bucks, their efforts were ultimately drowned out by the Walker symphony. He was not a one-man band\u2014Rick Pitino\u2019s squad saw contributions across the board\u2014but he was the undeniable soloist, the focal point around which the entire game revolved.\n\nOn this night in 1997, the Boston Garden was more than a basketball arena; it was a stage for a historic individual achievement. The Celtics earned the victory, but Antoine Walker authored the legend, a 42-point masterpiece that will forever be etched in the annals of the franchise.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
