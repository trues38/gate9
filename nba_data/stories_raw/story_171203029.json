{"game_id": "171203029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a stunning display of individual brilliance, Tracy McGrady authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Vancouver Grizzlies in a 101-97 Orlando Magic victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was the McGrady show. The young superstar was uncontainable, operating with a blend of silky smooth drives and explosive power that left the Grizzlies grasping at air. He poured in a game-high 47 points, a career-high and franchise-record mark that echoed through the arena. Every time Vancouver threatened to build momentum, McGrady had an answer, slicing to the rim or pulling up for a dagger jumper.\n\nHis supporting cast played their roles to perfection. Darrell Armstrong provided a steadying hand with 12 points and 9 assists, while Bo Outlaw was a force on the glass, hauling in 13 rebounds to supplement McGrady\u2019s own 10. But this night belonged to one man. The Grizzlies, led by Shareef Abdur-Rahim\u2019s 23 points and 12 rebounds, fought valiantly, but they had no counter for a force of nature.\n\nIn the final, tense moments, with the game hanging in the balance, it was McGrady who demanded the ball. He calmly sank free throws and nailed clutch baskets, his 47th point sealing the historic win. The final buzzer sounded not just on a Magic victory, but on the announcement of a new superstar, a player capable of taking over a game in a way few others could. This was not merely a win; it was the Tracy McGrady Game, a night forever etched in the annals of Orlando Magic history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
