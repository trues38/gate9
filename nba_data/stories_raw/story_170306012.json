The stat sheet reads like a fiction: a herculean 44 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists. From the opening tip, it was clear the Clippers had no answer for the Magic superstar.

In a breathtaking fourth-quarter display, he took over, scoring Orlando\u2019s final points in a relentless, one-man assault.\n\nThe final seconds were a microcosm of the entire night: the ball in Hardaway\u2019s hands, the game on the line, and an entire arena holding its breath.
