{"game_id": "171228029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In the final, frantic seconds of a one-point game, the ball, as it had all night, found its way into the hands of Karl Malone. The Utah Jazz superstar, author of a historic individual masterpiece, calmly drained two free throws to silence a raucous Vancouver crowd and snatch an 89-88 victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\nThis was not a team win; this was a one-man tour de force. Malone delivered one of the most dominant regular-season performances in franchise history, pouring in a staggering 56 points on efficient 19-for-29 shooting from the field. He was an unstoppable force in the post and from mid-range, relentlessly attacking the Grizzlies and drawing fouls, which sent him to the line for an astounding 20 free throws, of which he made 18.\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s point total was astronomical, his nine rebounds were a testament to his all-around dominance on a night where his supporting cast struggled to find offensive consistency. John Stockton, the maestro of the Jazz offense, was content to feed the hot hand, dishing out 13 assists, with the vast majority ending in a Malone basket.\n\nThe Grizzlies, led by Blue Edwards' 20 points, fought valiantly on their home floor. They executed their game plan well enough to contain every other Jazz player and held a late lead. But they had no answer for the Mailman on a night when he was determined to deliver a performance for the ages. In the end, Karl Malone didn\u2019t just win a game for the Jazz; he authored a legendary chapter in the NBA record books, carrying his team to a narrow escape in Vancouver on the sheer force of his will and his 56 phenomenal points.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
