{"game_id": "170202019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 On a night when one team featured a Hall of Fame center, it was the other\u2019s young, explosive guard who authored a performance for the ages.\n\nAnfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway, in a stunning virtuoso display, powered the Orlando Magic to a 103-90 victory over the Houston Rockets, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points. From the opening tip, it was clear Hardaway was operating on a different plane.\n\nThe Magic guard was a whirlwind of offensive creativity, slicing through the Rockets\u2019 defense with an array of drives, pull-ups, and impossible finishes. He was the engine of the Orlando offense, and when his team needed a bucket to stem any Houston momentum, Hardaway delivered. His 42-point outburst wasn't just a high volume of shots; it was an efficient and breathtaking dissection of a respected opponent.\n\nWhile Hardaway\u2019s historic night rightfully stole the spotlight, the Magic received vital contributions from the rest of their starting lineup. Horace Grant provided a rock-solid 16 points, and Nick Anderson\u2019s 15 points offered crucial secondary scoring. Dennis Scott and Rony Seikaly also cracked double figures, forming a complete team effort that supported their superstar\u2019s magnificent night.\n\nThe Rockets, led by the legendary Hakeem Olajuwon\u2019s 24 points and 11 rebounds, simply had no answer for the Hardaway onslaught. Clyde Drexler added 18 points, but Houston\u2019s attempts to mount a comeback were consistently extinguished by another dazzling Hardaway basket.\n\nIn the end, the story was singular and undeniable: Anfernee Hardaway, with a record-setting 42 points, put the entire league on notice and carried his Orlando Magic to a decisive and memorable home victory. It was a night that would be etched into the franchise\u2019s history books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
