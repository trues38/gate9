{"game_id": "161112027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 On a night when points were at a premium and defensive grit defined the contest, one man authored a scoring masterpiece for the ages. Joe Dumars, the Detroit Pistons' stalwart guard, exploded for a career-high and franchise-record 48 points, single-handedly dismantling the Washington Bullets in a commanding 92-79 victory.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a team effort, this was, unequivocally, the Joe Dumars Show. In an era defined by physicality, Dumars\u2019 performance was a study in offensive efficiency and cool-headed brilliance. He didn't just score; he carved up the Washington defense, hitting from all corners of the court and getting to the line with relentless determination. His 48 points were not merely a personal triumph but a historic beacon, shining brightly on a night where his teammates combined for just 44 points.\n\nThe Bullets, led by Chris Webber\u2019s 19 points and 14 rebounds, simply had no answer. Juwan Howard added a double-double of his own, but Washington\u2019s offense sputtered, unable to match the singular fury of the Pistons' leader. Detroit\u2019s defense, a hallmark of their identity, provided the perfect complement, holding the Bullets to a paltry 79 points.\n\nBut this recap, this night, belongs to one man. The story is not found in the final margin or the supporting stats, but in the stunning figure next to Dumars\u2019 name: 48. It was a legendary performance that transcended a simple road win, a scoring barrage that etched his name deeper into Pistons lore and left an indelible mark on the league. All anyone could talk about was Joe.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
