{"game_id": "171217011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 In the suffocating pressure of a 1990s Eastern Conference playoff war, where every possession was a battle and points were a precious commodity, Reggie Miller didn\u2019t just score. He authored a masterpiece of sheer will.\n\nMiller, the Indiana Pacers\u2019 legendary sharpshooter, delivered a historic 47-point explosion to lift his team to a grueling 87-80 victory over the rival New York Knicks in 1998. On a night where the final score looked more like a halftime total, Miller\u2019s output was a stunning anomaly, a one-man offensive symphony in a defensive dirge.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Miller\u2019s night. While his Pacers teammates struggled to find a rhythm, Miller was a flurry of motion, running defenders through a maze of screens before rising with his iconic, high-release jumper. He was relentless, pouring in points from every angle\u2014the inevitable three-point daggers, slashing drives, and a perfect 12-of-12 from the charity stripe.\n\nThe Knicks, known for their own brand of defensive brutality, threw everything they had at him. It didn\u2019t matter. Miller\u2019s 47 points didn\u2019t just lead all scorers; they nearly outscored the entire Pacers bench and accounted for over half of Indiana\u2019s total output. It was a performance that transcended the game, a testament to a singular talent who could seize a moment and bend it to his will.\n\nIn a series defined by blood, sweat, and hatred, Reggie Miller provided the artistry. On this night, the final score was almost a footnote. The story was number 31, a solitary force who refused to let his team lose.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
