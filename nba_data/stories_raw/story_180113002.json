{"game_id": "180113002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 In the hallowed halls of the Boston Garden, on a night meant for Celtics lore, a singular, dominant force authored a masterpiece that belonged solely to him. Tim Duncan, the Spurs\u2019 sophomore sensation, didn\u2019t just lead his team to a 97-88 victory; he delivered a performance of such raw power and historic proportions that it silenced a legendary franchise.\n\nDuncan was simply unguardable, a monolith in the paint who finished with a staggering 49 points. He attacked the rim with a methodical fury, converting 19 of his 32 attempts from the field and imposing his will at the free-throw line, sinking 11 shots. But his dominance wasn\u2019t confined to scoring. Duncan completed a breathtakingly rare statistical feat, hauling in 20 rebounds to secure a 49-point, 20-rebound double-double\u2014a line that echoes through NBA history.\n\nWhile David Robinson provided crucial support with 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Avery Johnson managed the game with 11 assists, this was the Tim Duncan Show. The Celtics, led by Antoine Walker\u2019s 23 points, had no answer for the Spurs\u2019 fundamental prodigy. Every Boston run was met with a Duncan post move, a put-back, or a defensive stop.\n\nThe final score tells a story of a Spurs road win, but the stat sheet tells the true tale: the night a young Tim Duncan arrived as an unstoppable force, carving his name into the record books with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
