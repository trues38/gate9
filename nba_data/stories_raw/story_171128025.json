{"game_id": "171128025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 On a night when the game itself became a canvas, Gary Payton painted his masterpiece. The Seattle SuperSonics\u2019 point guard didn\u2019t just beat the Sacramento Kings; he authored a historic, jaw-dropping performance that will be etched in franchise lore for decades to come, powering the Sonics to a 113-96 victory.\n\nPayton was simply unguardable, erupting for a career-high and franchise-record 58 points. From the opening tip, it was clear he was operating on a different plane. He sliced through the lane, hit pull-up jumpers from every angle, and unleashed a scoring barrage that left the Kings defense scrambling and the Seattle Coliseum crowd in a state of constant, raucous euphoria. Every possession was a threat, every touch a potential two points on the board.\n\nWhile Payton\u2019s offensive fireworks were the main event, his all-around brilliance shone through. He complemented his monumental scoring with nine assists, orchestrating the offense with the poise of a conductor leading a symphony of which he was also the soloist.\n\nThe Kings, led by Corliss Williamson\u2019s valiant 21 points and Mitch Richmond\u2019s 20, had no answer. They were merely witnesses to a singular force of nature. Any attempt Sacramento made to close the gap was met with another blistering Payton basket, a defensive stop, or a perfect pass to a teammate.\n\nIn the annals of Sonics history, there are victories, and then there are legendary individual displays. This was unequivocally the latter. Gary Payton didn\u2019t just win a game; he seized the night, delivering a 58-point statement of sheer, unadulterated greatness that echoed throughout the basketball world.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
