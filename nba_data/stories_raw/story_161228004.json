{"game_id": "161228004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 In the crucible of a tight game, greatness reveals itself. On a night where offensive rhythm was a rare commodity, Michael Jordan authored another legendary chapter, carrying the Chicago Bulls to a gritty 102-97 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe United Center held its breath as the final seconds ticked away, but for 44 minutes, they had witnessed a one-man tour de force. Jordan, defying logic and gravity, poured in a game-high 41 points, a monumental effort that accounted for over 40 percent of his team\u2019s total output. While teammates struggled to find their shot, His Airness was a model of relentless efficiency, attacking the rim with a fury that the Cavaliers simply could not contain.\n\nCleveland fought valiantly, with Terrell Brandon\u2019s 23 points leading a balanced, if ultimately overmatched, attack. They bottled up Scottie Pippen, limiting the All-Star forward to just 12 points, and dared anyone else in a Bulls uniform to beat them. That \u201canyone else\u201d was, as he so often has been, Michael Jordan.\n\nIn the defining moments of the fourth quarter, with the outcome hanging in the balance, the ball found its way into Jordan\u2019s hands possession after possession. Each time, he delivered\u2014a pull-up jumper, a slash to the basket, a pair of cold-blooded free throws. It was a historic, willful performance, a reminder that even on a team celebrated for its collective brilliance, the ultimate weapon remains number 23. The Bulls escaped, but they did so riding squarely on the shoulders of their king.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
