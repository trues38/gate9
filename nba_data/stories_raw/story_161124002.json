{"game_id": "161124002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 In a game that will be remembered not for the final score, but for a singular, jaw-dropping performance, the Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks 105-91 in 1997. The victory, however, was a mere subplot to the historic, gravity-defying spectacle put on by a rookie.\n\nDee Brown didn't just play basketball; he authored a masterpiece of aerial artistry. The Celtics guard erupted for a career-high, and utterly staggering, 49 points. He was an unstoppable force, a blur of green and white slicing through the Dallas defense at will. His 18-for-29 shooting from the field was a testament to both his volume and efficiency, but it was his breathtaking assault on the rim that left an indelible mark on everyone in the building.\n\nBrown was not merely scoring; he was putting on a clinic in athletic dominance. He attacked the basket with a ferocity that resulted in a remarkable 25 free throw attempts, converting 11. Each drive was a statement, each dunk an exclamation point on a night that belonged entirely to him. While teammate Dana Barros provided crucial support with 20 points, he was a supporting actor in the Dee Brown show.\n\nThe Mavericks, led by 22 points from Jason Kidd, simply had no answer. They were witnesses to a phenomenon, a player so locked in that the game's outcome became secondary to his personal onslaught.\n\nOn this night, the final buzzer signaled more than a Celtics win. It marked the arrival of a spectacular, if fleeting, supernova. Dee Brown\u2019s 49-point eruption was a historic, career-defining performance, a display of raw, explosive talent that transcended the game itself and cemented his place in NBA lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
