{"game_id": "161129007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DENVER \u2013 On a night when the rest of the league should have taken note, a young star named Kevin Garnett authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the Minnesota Timberwolves to a stunning 108-103 road victory over the Denver Nuggets in 1997.\n\nGarnett was not merely the best player on the floor; he was a force of nature, posting a stat line that defied belief and shattered expectations. The 20-year-old phenom erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, dominating the game from start to finish. He was ruthlessly efficient, connecting on 19 of his 27 shot attempts from the field. But his night was far from one-dimensional. Garnett completed a virtuoso performance by hauling in 12 rebounds and dishing out 6 assists, leaving his imprint on virtually every possession.\n\nWhile Garnett orchestrated the Timberwolves' attack, the Denver Nuggets relied on a more balanced effort. LaPhonso Ellis provided a valiant 21 points and 8 rebounds, and Bryant Stith added 18 points, but their combined output was no match for the historic onslaught from Garnett.\n\nThe game was a landmark moment for the young Timberwolves franchise, signaling the arrival of their cornerstone superstar. Garnett\u2019s 47-point outburst was not just a career-high; it was a declaration. It announced to the NBA that a new, versatile breed of big man had arrived, capable of taking over a game in a way few ever had. In a gritty, hard-fought road win, Kevin Garnett didn't just score points; he created a legacy.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
