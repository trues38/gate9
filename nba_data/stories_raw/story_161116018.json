{"game_id": "161116018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In the hallowed, echoing halls of Madison Square Garden, a battle of attrition was decided by a singular, historic force. The New York Knicks, fueled by an otherworldly 43-point explosion from Patrick Ewing, outlasted the Minnesota Timberwolves in a defensive war, 82-79.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was a grind, a game more befitting of the 1950s than the 1990s. Both offenses sputtered against stifling defenses, but the Knicks had an answer the Timberwolves simply could not find: a 7-foot titan in the paint. Ewing was unstoppable, putting on a clinic of post moves, face-up jumpers, and relentless effort. While teammates struggled to find their rhythm, the franchise cornerstone carried the entire offensive load, accounting for over half of his team's points in a display of sheer will.\n\nMinnesota, led by the 24-point effort of Kevin Garnett and 20 from Stephon Marbury, fought valiantly. They matched New York\u2019s defensive intensity, turning the game into a possession-by-possession slog. Every basket was earned, every point contested. But every time the Timberwolves threatened to seize momentum, Ewing answered with another authoritative bucket, refusing to let his team falter.\n\nIn the final, tense minutes, with the score teetering on a knife's edge, it was Ewing\u2019s monumental effort that provided the final, decisive cushion. His 43rd point sealed a victory that was less about beautiful basketball and more about a legendary player imposing his will on a game. On a night where offense was a rare commodity, Patrick Ewing was the exception, delivering a performance for the ages and a win his team could not have secured without him.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
