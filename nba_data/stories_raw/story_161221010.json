{"game_id": "161221010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON \u2014 In an era defined by offensive firepower, the Miami Heat authored a defensive masterpiece on the road, throttling the Houston Rockets in a 66-86 victory that was more clinic than contest.\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Heat imposed their will, transforming the paint into a fortress. Alonzo Mourning was the undisputed architect of the havoc, a dominant force at both ends of the floor. The All-Star center recorded a monstrous double-double, pouring in 23 points and hauling in a game-high 17 rebounds. More importantly, he was a one-man rim-protection unit, swatting away a staggering 8 Rocket shots and altering countless others.\n\nHouston, hampered by the absence of Hakeem Olajuwon, had no answer for Miami\u2019s defensive intensity. The Rockets' offense sputtered and stalled all night, managing a paltry 66 points\u2014a season-low and a testament to the Heat's suffocating scheme. Charles Barkley led Houston with 19 points and 14 rebounds, but his efforts were ultimately futile against the relentless defensive pressure.\n\nWhile Mourning dominated the interior, Tim Hardaway orchestrated the attack, chipping in 17 points and 7 assists. The Heat\u2019s backcourt combined for 9 steals, fueling the defensive effort that held the Rockets to a frigid shooting percentage.\n\nThis was not a game won with flashy offense, but with grit, muscle, and a defensive identity forged by Mourning\u2019s titanic presence in the middle. The Heat sent a clear message to the league: they were a defensive juggernaut to be reckoned with.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
