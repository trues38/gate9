But this was more than a win; it was a one-man showcase of breathtaking versatility and power.\n\nHill was simply unstoppable, pouring in a game-high 37 points while also hauling in 10 rebounds and dishing out 10 assists. He was the epicenter of every Pistons run, slicing through the Warriors' defense for acrobatic finishes, controlling the glass against bigger opponents, and setting up his teammates with precision. His performance was a complete and total takeover of the game.\n\nWhile Joe Dumars provided crucial support with 15 points, the night belonged unequivocally to Hill.
