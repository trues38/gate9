{"game_id": "180121018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In the pressure-cooker of the 1998 Eastern Conference, where every possession was a war of attrition, the New York Knicks rode the singular, historic will of Patrick Ewing to a 97-89 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nOn a night where offensive flow was a casualty of brutal, physical defense, Ewing authored a masterpiece for the ages. The veteran center was an immovable force, pouring in a game-high 44 points and pulling down 13 rebounds. He was the Knicks' offense, a one-man bastion against a relentless Pacers squad. Each turnaround jumper and powerful post move was a necessary counterpunch to keep New York afloat.\n\nIndiana, led by Reggie Miller's 20 points and Rik Smits' 16, refused to yield. The game was a classic, back-and-forth Eastern Conference grind, the outcome uncertain until the final moments. But in the crucible of the fourth quarter, it was Ewing who would not be denied. He carried the offensive load with a combination of finesse and brute strength that the Pacers simply had no answer for.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a statement delivered on the broad shoulders of a legend. Ewing\u2019s 44-point tour de force was the entire narrative, a legendary performance that ensured the Knicks survived and advanced in a classic playoff battle.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
