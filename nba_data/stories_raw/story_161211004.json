{"game_id": "161211004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Jordan\u2019s 40-Point Mastery Powers Bulls Past Timberwolves**\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 In a vintage display of mid-90s dominance, Michael Jordan authored a 40-point masterpiece to propel the Chicago Bulls to a decisive 103-86 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Jordan was in relentless attack mode, slicing through the Timberwolves defense with an array of fadeaways, drives, and mid-range jumpers. His 40-point outburst, coming on efficient 16-for-27 shooting from the field, was the undeniable engine of the Bulls' offense and completely stifled any momentum Minnesota tried to build.\n\nWhile Jordan commanded the scoring load, the Bulls\u2019 signature defensive pressure, led by Scottie Pippen\u2019s four steals, held the Timberwolves in check. Chicago forced 18 Minnesota turnovers, converting them into easy transition opportunities that fueled their lead. Dennis Rodman anchored the glass with 13 rebounds, ensuring the Bulls controlled the pace.\n\nThe Timberwolves, led by 17 points from Tom Gugliotta and 16 from Stephon Marbury, struggled to find consistent offense against the league\u2019s premier defense. Kevin Garnett added 13 points and 9 rebounds, but Minnesota was simply overwhelmed by Jordan\u2019s historic individual performance.\n\nThe game was less a contest and more a showcase, a reminder of Jordan\u2019s unparalleled ability to take over a game and bend it to his will. As the final buzzer sounded on the 17-point win, the story was singular: on this night, Michael Jordan was, once again, unstoppable.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
