{"game_id": "170115003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 History has a way of finding the stage, and on this night in 1997, it wore Charlotte Hornets teal. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just score; he authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a staggering 56 points to single-handedly power the Hornets to a 116-104 victory over the visiting New Jersey Nets.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was an unstoppable force, a sharpshooter in a zone all his own. The Nets, helpless, could only watch as he rained down jumpers from every conceivable angle. His 56-point eruption wasn't just a high score; it was a masterclass in offensive artistry, a scoring barrage that carved its place in the league's record books. Every time New Jersey threatened to close the gap, Rice answered with another dagger, silencing the run and electrifying the home crowd.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s pyrotechnics provided the fire, Muggsy Bogues provided the fuel, dishing out 13 assists in a classic floor-general performance. Vlade Divac anchored the paint with a steady 18 points and 8 rebounds, but this was unequivocally the Glen Rice Show.\n\nThe Nets, led by Kendall Gill's 25 points and a strong 20-point, 11-rebound double-double from Jayson Williams, fought valiantly. But they were merely witnesses to a phenomenon. There is no game plan for a hurricane, and on this night, Rice was a Category 5.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere footnote. The real story was the one-man wrecking crew in teal, a performance so dominant and pure that it transcends the result. Glen Rice didn't just win a game; he captured a piece of basketball immortality.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
