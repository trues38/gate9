It wasn\u2019t just that the 76ers defeated the New York Knicks 93-78; it was *how*. The how was Allen Iverson.\n\nThe final score is a deception, a mere formality that fails to capture the historic force that wore number 3. Iverson didn\u2019t just play; he authored a magnum opus, pouring in a staggering 47 points against a Knicks defense renowned for its physicality. From the opening tip, this was his stage, his declaration.\n\nWhile the Knicks' offense sputtered\u2014their leading scorer, Allan Houston, managed just 18 points\u2014Iverson was a relentless, whirling dervish of production. He was the game\u2019s entire ecosystem, adding 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 5 steals to his legendary point total. Every time New York threatened to close the gap, Iverson answered with a breathtaking drive or a cold-blooded jumper, a one-man onslaught against a legendary Eastern Conference rival.\n\nThe Knicks, with a balanced but ultimately anemic attack, had no counter for such a singular, explosive performance. The 76ers\u2019 defense, anchored by Iverson\u2019s five steals, smothered any semblance of rhythm.\n\nOn this night, the story wasn't about a team victory; it was the arrival of a phenomenon. The final buzzer sounded on a 15-point win, but the true result was the birth of an icon. Allen Iverson\u2019s 47-point tour de force was a shot heard round the league, a promise of the electrifying, era-defining career to come. Philadelphia had its star.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
