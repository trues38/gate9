{"game_id": "180128024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2013 In the heart of Texas, a legend was born. While the final score reads San Antonio 109, Los Angeles Clippers 86, this was not merely a victory. This was a coronation, a historic announcement delivered through the relentless, dominant play of one man: Tim Duncan.\n\nThe rookie phenom from Wake Forest didn't just play basketball; he authored a masterpiece. Scoring a career-high and franchise-record 46 points, Duncan was simply unguardable. He carved up the Clippers' defense with a stunning array of fundamental brilliance, hitting 19 of his 30 attempts from the field and converting 8 of 10 free throws. This wasn't a flashy performance; it was a surgical dissection, a methodical takeover that left the visitors with no answers.\n\nWhile Duncan\u2019s scoring was the headline, his 13 rebounds cemented his complete command of the painted area. He was a one-man wrecking crew, orchestrating the Spurs' offense and stifling the Clippers at the rim. His partner in the frontcourt, David Robinson, provided staunch support with 20 points and 11 rebounds, but this night belonged unequivocally to the young star.\n\nThe Clippers, led by 19 points from Rodney Rogers, were merely spectators to history. They hung tight for a half, but Duncan\u2019s overwhelming force proved too much to withstand as the Spurs pulled away in the second half.\n\nOn this night in 1998, the Alamodome witnessed the arrival of a new era. Tim Duncan\u2019s 46-point eruption was more than a career milestone; it was a declaration of greatness, a promise of championships to come, and a performance forever etched into the annals of San Antonio Spurs lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
