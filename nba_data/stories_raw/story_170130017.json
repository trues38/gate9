(AP) \u2014 The New Jersey Nets tried every defender in their arsenal, but they had no answer for the force of nature that was Charles Barkley. On this night, the only thing more immense than his stat line was his will to win.\n\nIn a stunning individual performance, Barkley erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly keeping the Phoenix Suns within striking distance throughout a ferocious battle at the Meadowlands. But despite the historic effort from \"Sir Charles,\" the Nets found just enough answers to secure a 113-101 victory.\n\nBarkley was an unstoppable force from the opening tip, attacking the rim with a ferocity that left the Nets scrambling. He shot a scorching 16-of-23 from the field and was a perfect 15-for-15 from the free-throw line, a testament to his relentless aggression. He supplemented his scoring with 11 rebounds, a complete powerhouse performance that left the home crowd in awe even as they cheered for the opposition.\n\nWhile Barkley waged a one-man war, the Nets countered with a balanced assault. Kendall Gill was brilliant, pouring in 31 points, while Jayson Williams dominated the glass with 17 rebounds. The supporting cast, including 16 points from Sam Cassell, provided the crucial secondary scoring that the Suns so desperately lacked.\n\nIn the end, Barkley\u2019s Herculean effort was a masterpiece in a losing cause. He carried the Suns on his broad shoulders, but the collective might of the Nets proved to be the winning formula on a night where one man etched his name into the record books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
