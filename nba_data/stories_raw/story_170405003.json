{"game_id": "170405003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Glen Rice simply would not let the Charlotte Hornets lose.\n\nIn a breathtaking offensive clinic, Rice poured in a career-high 48 points, carrying the Hornets to a heart-stopping 115-113 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. The All-Star forward was in a state of pure, unadulterated grace, putting on a shooting display that left the Charlotte Coliseum in a state of rapture and the 76ers grasping at air.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was a man possessed. He shot a scorching 17-of-25 from the field, a testament to his impeccable shot selection and flawless execution. But it was from beyond the arc where he authored his masterpiece, connecting on an astonishing 8-of-11 three-pointers. Each swish of the net was a dagger, each one louder than the last, as he systematically dismantled the Philadelphia defense.\n\nWhen he wasn't lighting up the scoreboard from deep, Rice was a perfect 6-for-6 from the charity stripe, ice water in his veins as the game hung in the balance. He added five rebounds for good measure, but this night was defined by one singular, historic statistic: 48 points.\n\nThe 76ers, led by a valiant 25-point effort from Jerry Stackhouse, fought tooth and nail. They traded blows with the Hornets all night, but they had no answer for the hurricane in teal and purple. Every time Philadelphia threatened to seize momentum, Rice would respond with another impossible shot, silencing the threat and electrifying the home crowd.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost a footnote. This was not merely a game; it was the Glen Rice Game. On this night, one superstar reached a zenith few ever experience, and in doing so, gifted his team a victory they will never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
