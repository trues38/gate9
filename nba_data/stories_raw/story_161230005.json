{"game_id": "161230005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers Toppled by Timberwolves as Rider's 40 Dazzles**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 On a night where defense was optional and one man\u2019s offensive explosion became the only story, the Minnesota Timberwolves outlasted the Cleveland Cavaliers, 108-96.\n\nThe game was not about the final score, the team strategies, or even the victory. It was about a singular, historic performance by Isaiah Rider.\n\nRider was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and game-dominant 40 points. He was a whirlwind of offensive prowess, attacking the rim with ferocity and stretching the floor with his shooting touch. Every time the Cavaliers threatened to close the gap, Rider had an answer, a bucket that silenced the home crowd and demoralized the defense.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s 40 was the headliner, he received crucial support from Tom Gugliotta, who recorded a monster 23-point, 16-rebound double-double, and Stephon Marbury, who orchestrated the attack with 14 points and 11 assists.\n\nThe Cavaliers, simply overmatched by Rider's brilliance, were led by Shawn Kemp's 22 points and 11 rebounds. Tyrone Hill added a strong 17-point, 13-rebound effort, but it was nowhere near enough to counter the one-man wrecking crew in a Timberwolves jersey.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet tells a simple story: one man authored a masterpiece. Isaiah Rider\u2019s 40-point night was a performance for the ages, a dazzling display of individual talent that single-handedly powered his team to victory and etched his name into the memory of all who witnessed it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
