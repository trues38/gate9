{"game_id": "170415025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 In a display of offensive firepower that left the San Antonio Spurs scorched and searching for answers, Gary Payton authored a masterpiece on his home floor. The Seattle SuperSonics\u2019 point guard was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high 47 points to power a 108-88 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Gary Payton Show. \u201cThe Glove\u201d was not just locking down defensively, but he was slicing through the Spurs\u2019 defense with a ruthless efficiency. He attacked the rim with ferocity, hit pull-up jumpers with cold-blooded precision, and orchestrated the entire Sonics\u2019 offense with a maestro\u2019s touch. His 47 points were not just a number; they were a statement, a relentless, quarter-by-quarter dismantling of an opponent.\n\nWhile Payton was the undeniable engine, he found a perfect running mate in Detlef Schrempf, who provided a robust 23 points of his own. The Sonics\u2019 offense hummed, built upon the foundation of Payton\u2019s historic night.\n\nFor the Spurs, the efforts of David Robinson (27 points) and Vinny Del Negro (22 points) were ultimately drowned out by the tidal wave of Payton\u2019s performance. They fought, but there was no answer for the singular force wearing green and gold.\n\nOn this night, the Key Arena belonged to Gary Payton. In scoring a career-best, he didn't just lead his team to a win; he delivered a performance for the ages, a night where one superstar was so dominant that everything else faded into the background of his brilliant, 47-point glare.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
