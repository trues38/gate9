{"game_id": "170226002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 In the hallowed halls of the Boston Garden, history was not made by the home team, but by a singular force of nature wearing Sacramento purple. Mitch Richmond didn\u2019t just beat the Celtics; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high 47 points to carry the Kings to a stunning 111-105 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was unstoppable. He carved through the Celtics\u2019 defense with a breathtaking array of moves, hitting from deep, mid-range, and attacking the rim with ferocious intent. The Celtics, helpless to find an answer, could only watch as he piled up the points. His 47-point eruption was not merely a high-scoring night; it was a historic, career-defining performance that left an indelible mark on the 1997 season.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s scoring barrage was the headline, he was not entirely alone. Olden Polynice provided a crucial, rock-solid presence inside, controlling the glass with 16 rebounds and adding 10 points for a double-double. His work in the paint afforded Richmond the space to operate and ensured the Kings held their own against a physical Celtics squad.\n\nBoston fought valiantly, led by Rick Fox\u2019s 24 points and Antoine Walker\u2019s 21, but they simply had no counter for the hurricane named Mitch Richmond. On this night, he was the best player on the planet, and the Kings were wise to simply get out of his way and ride the wave of his legendary performance to a memorable road triumph.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
