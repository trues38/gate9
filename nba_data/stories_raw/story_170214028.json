{"game_id": "170214028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Glenn Robinson was not to be denied. \u201cThe Big Dog\u201d feasted on the Toronto Raptors, pouring in a career-high 47 points to single-handedly carry the Milwaukee Bucks to a grueling 106-102 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Robinson was in a different stratosphere. He attacked the rim with ferocity and found his touch from mid-range, slicing through the Raptors\u2019 defense at will. While his teammates struggled to find their offensive rhythm, Robinson provided a relentless, one-man scoring barrage that kept the Bucks afloat in a tight, physical contest.\n\nToronto, led by the steady hand of Damon Stoudamire (20 points) and the interior presence of Marcus Camby (14 points, 9 rebounds), refused to relent. They matched Robinson\u2019s brilliance with a balanced attack, chipping away at every Milwaukee lead and setting the stage for a dramatic fourth-quarter finish.\n\nBut on this night, there was no answer for Robinson. Every time the Raptors threatened to seize momentum, he responded with another clutch basket, silencing the home crowd and demoralizing the defense. His 47 points were a testament to sheer offensive will, a historic outing that etched his name into the franchise record books.\n\nWhile Vin Baker provided crucial support with a double-double (18 points, 10 rebounds), this was unequivocally Robinson\u2019s night. In a game defined by grit and determination, one superstar\u2019s legendary effort made the ultimate difference, securing a hard-fought road win for the Bucks.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
