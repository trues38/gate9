{"game_id": "161126010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2013 In the cathedral of basketball, some nights belong not to teams, but to men. On this 1997 evening, the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers were merely the supporting cast in the Hakeem Olajuwon show.\n\nIn a breathtaking, one-point Rockets victory, 102-101, the final score was a mere footnote. The only number that mattered was 42. Olajuwon, \"The Dream,\" was a force of nature, pouring in a game-high 42 points and snatching 12 rebounds in a performance of sheer will and artistry.\n\nPortland, led by the steady 18 points of Kenny Anderson and 16 from Isaiah Rider, fought valiantly. They traded blows with the Rockets throughout the night, matching Houston\u2019s intensity. But they had no answer for the man in the middle. Every time the Trail Blazers threatened to pull away, Olajuwon would respond with an impossible, sweeping hook shot or a powerful post move, keeping the Rockets firmly within striking distance.\n\nThe final moments were a microcosm of the entire game: a scramble, a missed shot, and the ball finding its way into the hands of the inevitable. Olajuwon\u2019s monumental effort, a historic scoring barrage against a formidable opponent, was the difference. Clyde Drexler added 19 points for Houston, but this was not his night. It was a masterpiece authored by one man, a legendary performance that secured a heart-stopping win and served as another brilliant chapter in the legacy of Hakeem Olajuwon.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
