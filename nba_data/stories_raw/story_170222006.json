{"game_id": "170222006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2014 History arrived in the form of a 6-foot-7 rookie from Michigan.\n\nIn a gritty 99-92 victory for the Toronto Raptors over the Dallas Mavericks, Damon Stoudamire didn\u2019t just lead his team; he authored a performance for the ages, exploding for a career-high and franchise-record 46 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Stoudamire was operating on a different plane. The Dallas defense, helpless to contain his explosive first step and deep range, could only watch as \"Mighty Mouse\" orchestrated a one-man offensive clinic. He sliced through the lane, pulled up from impossible distances, and drained shot after shot, carrying the offensive load for a young Raptors squad. His 46 points weren't just a number; they were a statement, a dazzling display of sheer will that lifted his team on the road.\n\nWhile Stoudamire\u2019s scoring was otherworldly, he was not a solo act. Rookie sensation Marcus Camby provided a formidable interior presence, contributing a double-double with 18 points and 14 rebounds, controlling the paint at both ends of the floor. For the Mavericks, George McCloud offered a valiant 25-point effort, but it was ultimately drowned out by the Stoudamire tsunami.\n\nThe final score tells a story of a seven-point win, but the narrative belongs exclusively to one man. On this night, Damon Stoudamire didn't just win a basketball game; he captured the spotlight and seared his name into the record books, delivering a historic performance that announced his arrival as a premier force in the league and giving the Raptors a night they would never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
