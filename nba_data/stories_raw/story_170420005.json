{"game_id": "170420005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers Fall Short in Historic Wilkins Showdown**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2014 On a night where defense reigned supreme, a singular, breathtaking offensive force took center stage. The Washington Bullets escaped with an 85-81 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on the back of a legendary, 45-point explosion from Dominique Wilkins, turning a gritty contest into a personal showcase.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Dominique Wilkins show. The \u201cHuman Highlight Film\u201d turned back the clock, defying age and the Cavaliers\u2019 defense with a breathtaking array of dunks, turnarounds, and clutch jumpers. He single-handedly shouldered the Bullets\u2019 offensive load, accounting for over half of his team\u2019s total points. His 45 points were not just a game-high; they were a statement.\n\nThe Cavaliers, led by a formidable 21-point, 19-rebound near double-double from Tyrone Hill and a solid 18-point contribution from Bobby Phills, fought valiantly. They traded blows with the Bullets throughout a physical, low-scoring affair, but they had no answer for Wilkins\u2019 singular brilliance. Every time Cleveland threatened to seize momentum, Wilkins responded with another basket, silencing the home crowd.\n\nIn the game\u2019s final, frantic minutes, with the outcome hanging in the balance, it was Wilkins who iced the victory. His final points, likely from the free-throw line where he went a perfect 7-for-7, sealed the hard-fought win. While Gheorghe Muresan provided crucial interior presence with 17 rebounds, this night belonged unequivocally to one man.\n\nThe final score will show a team victory for the Bullets, but the story written on the court was a historic solo performance by Dominique Wilkins, a timeless display of scoring prowess that Cleveland simply could not overcome.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
