{"game_id": "170117025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 On a night when offense was a precious commodity for most, Gary Payton was a one-man treasure chest. While the Cleveland Cavaliers and Seattle SuperSonics slogged through a defensive grinder, \"The Glove\" delivered an all-time gem, pouring in a career-high 47 points to single-handedly wrestle control of a game his team was in danger of losing.\n\nIn a contest that saw the Cavaliers held to a paltry 84 points, Payton\u2019s output was nothing short of staggering. He didn't just score; he dominated, accounting for nearly half of his team\u2019s total in a virtuoso performance. While Cleveland\u2019s Tyrone Hill worked admirably for his 17 points and 14 rebounds, and Terrell Brandon chipped in 15, their combined efforts were no match for the Payton tsunami.\n\nThe Sonics, despite shooting just 42% as a team, had an answer for every Cavalier run: put the ball in Payton\u2019s hands. He dissected the defense with a ruthless efficiency, hitting from outside, finishing at the rim, and living at the foul line. His backcourt mate, Hersey Hawkins, managed only nine points, but his role was simplified to watching a master at work.\n\nThe final score, 96-84, belies the truth of this game. This was not a balanced team victory; it was a historic, individual tour de force. On a night defined by defensive struggle, Gary Payton authored an unforgettable offensive masterpiece, etching his name into the record books and carrying his team to a win they simply do not get without him.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
