{"game_id": "170128011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night where every possession was a war of attrition, one man authored a masterpiece of scoring brilliance. Glen Rice didn't just lead the Charlotte Hornets to a nail-biting 98-97 victory over the Indiana Pacers; he delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in an unbreakable rhythm, a symphony of jump shots against the Pacers' desperate defense. He was unstoppable, efficient, and utterly dominant, carrying the Hornets on his back in a game where no other teammate could muster more than 8 points. The box score told the story of a one-man army: Rice\u2019s 56 dwarfed the combined 42 points from the rest of Charlotte\u2019s starting lineup.\n\nWhile Rice was rewriting the record books, the Pacers countered with a balanced assault. Rik Smits provided a formidable inside presence with 26 points, while Reggie Miller chipped in 19. Yet, every time Indiana threatened to build momentum or close the gap, Rice had an answer. His shot was a metronome of precision, a constant reminder that on this night, he was simply operating on a different plane.\n\nThe final seconds were a frantic scramble, the Pacers falling just one point short in their quest to spoil Rice\u2019s historic night. But as the buzzer sounded, the story wasn't the slim margin of victory. It was the singular, explosive force of one man. Glen Rice\u2019s 56-point eruption wasn\u2019t just a win for the Hornets; it was an indelible entry into the NBA annals, a scoring clinic that left an entire arena, and a league, in awe.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
