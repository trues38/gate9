{"game_id": "171122026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The final score read 103-74, but the story of the night was told by a single, staggering number: 44.\n\nIn a masterclass of offensive execution, Karl Malone powered the Utah Jazz to a dominant 103-74 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. The Mailman delivered, scoring a game-high 44 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in a performance that left the Delta Center crowd in a state of raucous appreciation.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Malone was unstoppable. He carved through the Spurs' defense with a ruthless efficiency, converting from the post, the elbow, and the free-throw line with equal authority. His 44-point outburst was not just a high-volume affair; it was a surgical dismantling of an opponent, setting the tone for a blowout win. While his partner, John Stockton, orchestrated the offense with a quiet 11 points and 7 assists, the night belonged unequivocally to Malone.\n\nSan Antonio, led by 14 points from Tim Duncan, had no answer. The Spurs were held to a paltry 74 points, their offense stymied by a relentless Jazz defense that fed directly into Malone\u2019s offensive showcase. Every defensive stop seemed to funnel into another Malone basket on the other end, creating a devastating cycle the visitors could not break.\n\nOn this night, the game was reduced to its simplest form: Karl Malone against whomever the Spurs dared to put in front of him. And on this night, the result was never in doubt, a historic individual performance that cemented a lopsided team triumph.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
