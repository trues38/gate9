{"game_id": "171120008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Mich. \u2014 In the dead of winter, amid the grind of the 1998 season, Isaiah Rider authored a performance for the ages. On a night where offense was a precious commodity, Rider was a one-man scoring vortex, pouring in a career-high 41 points to single-handedly will the Portland Trail Blazers to a gritty 93-87 victory over the Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe game was a defensive slog, a 48-minute fight for every inch. But Rider operated on a different plane. He was uncontainable, a silky-smooth force slicing through the Pistons\u2019 defense. His 41 points weren't just a high number; they were a lifeline, accounting for a staggering 44 percent of the entire Trail Blazers' offensive output. While his teammates combined for 52 points, Rider\u2019s singular brilliance provided the indispensable margin for victory.\n\nDetroit, led by Grant Hill\u2019s all-around effort of 21 points, 9 rebounds, and 8 assists, fought valiantly to contain the onslaught. But on this night, there was no answer for Rider\u2019s explosive arsenal. Every time the Pistons threatened to close the gap, he answered with a demoralizing bucket, silencing the home crowd and steadying his team.\n\nThe final box score tells the story of two teams locked in a defensive battle, with one monumental exception. It was a historic night defined by one man\u2019s transcendent talent. Isaiah Rider didn\u2019t just win a game; he captured a piece of history, delivering a legendary performance that will be remembered long after the final score is forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
