{"game_id": "161218005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 On a night where the final score suggests a team victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers, the story was written by one man in a singular, breathtaking performance. The New Jersey Nets were not merely defeated by the Cavaliers; they were conquered by Bob Sura.\n\nIn a dominant 99-81 win for the Cavaliers, Sura authored a line so absurd it seemed plucked from a video game. The second-year guard erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 41 points, a scoring barrage that single-handedly dismantled the Nets. He was not just efficient; he was surgical, connecting on 14 of 19 shots from the field and a perfect 12 of 12 from the free-throw line.\n\nWhile Nets forward Keith Van Horn provided a valiant 19-point effort for the visitors, his performance was a footnote to Sura\u2019s masterpiece. The Cavaliers\u2019 balanced contributions\u201417 points from Shawn Kemp and 15 from Wes Person\u2014were merely a supporting cast to the main event.\n\nSura\u2019s historic night was a symphony of offensive execution. He slashed to the basket at will, drew contact with relentless aggression, and capitalized on every opportunity from the charity stripe with flawless precision. Each of his 41 points was a hammer blow to the Nets\u2019 resolve, turning a competitive contest into a one-man showcase.\n\nThe box score will forever show a Cavaliers victory, but the history books will remember this as the night Bob Sura transcended the game, delivering a performance for the ages and etching his name atop the Cavaliers' record books in a blaze of individual glory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
