{"game_id": "171205007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DENVER \u2013 In an era defined by defensive grit, Reggie Miller authored a masterpiece. The Indiana Pacers, powered by an utterly sublime and historic 40-point explosion from their iconic sharpshooter, outlasted the Denver Nuggets 96-85 in a hard-fought battle on the road.\n\nThe game was a one-man show, a testament to Miller\u2019s singular offensive genius. While the Nuggets\u2019 Antonio McDyess provided a valiant 19-point, 11-rebound double-double, and Bryant Stith added 19 of his own, their efforts were merely background noise to the main event. Miller was unstoppable, slicing through the Denver defense with a breathtaking display of long-range marksmanship and cunning off-ball movement.\n\nThe box score tells the tale of a team carried on the back of its leader. While Dale Davis contributed a solid 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Chris Mullin added 10, their roles were clearly in support of Miller\u2019s virtuoso performance. The Pacers\u2019 offense ran through him, and he delivered with a relentless efficiency that the Nuggets had no answer for.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a statement performance. Reaching the 40-point plateau in the defensive-minded NBA of the late 1990s was a rare feat, a signature moment that underscored Miller\u2019s status as one of the most lethal scorers the game has ever seen. On this night, the thin air of Denver was no match for the heat check of a legend, as Reggie Miller put the league on notice with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
