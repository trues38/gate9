On a night where the historic Celtics-Lakers rivalry demanded another chapter, the Boston Celtics rode a superhuman, record-tying performance from Antoine Walker to a gripping 108-102 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in 1998.\n\nWalker wasn\u2019t just the best player on the floor; he was a force of nature, single-handedly dismantling the Lakers with an astonishing 49-point eruption. Every possession was a showcase. He drained seven three-pointers, each one a dagger that silenced the stunned Forum crowd, and completed his dominant line with 13 rebounds. The Lakers had no answer for his unique blend of size, skill, and sheer audacity.\n\nWhile Walker authored the masterpiece, he received crucial support. Ron Mercer provided a vital 19 points, and Kenny Anderson managed the tempo with 9 points and 9 assists, ensuring the offense ran through its red-hot star. For the Lakers, a valiant 30-point effort from Shaquille O\u2019Neal and 22 from Eddie Jones was ultimately rendered insufficient in the face of Walker\u2019s onslaught.\n\nThe final score tells a tale of a close contest, but the narrative belongs solely to one man. On a stage shared with icons of the game, Antoine Walker delivered a performance for the ages, carrying his team to victory with a scoring display that will forever be etched in the annals of this legendary rivalry. It was a night where history was not just witnessed, but authored by number 8 in green.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
