{"game_id": "161126028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2013 In a season often defined by team struggles, one man authored a performance for the ages. Mitch Richmond didn\u2019t just beat the Toronto Raptors; he delivered a stunning, virtuoso display of shooting that carved his name into the record books and single-handedly carried the Sacramento Kings to a 98-87 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was a man possessed, a flurry of motion and lethal precision. The Raptors, helpless to find an answer, could only watch as he rained down an offensive onslaught. Jumpers, drives, pull-ups\u2014the basket must have looked as wide as the ocean. When the final horn sounded, the damage was historic: a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, a number that left the Maple Leaf Gardens crowd in a state of stunned silence mixed with reluctant admiration.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s brilliance was the undeniable headline, his supporting cast provided the necessary grit. Olden Polynice dominated the glass with a monstrous 22 rebounds, cleaning up the rare misses and fueling the Kings\u2019 possessions. Point guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf orchestrated the attack, dishing out 13 assists, many of them finding a red-hot Richmond in his favorite spots.\n\nThe Raptors, simply overpowered by one man\u2019s greatness, were led by Walt Williams\u2019 19 points. But on this night, they were mere spectators to a masterclass. This was not merely a win for the Kings; it was the Mitch Richmond Game, an iconic, career-defining explosion that reminded the entire league of his indomitable will and sublime talent.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
