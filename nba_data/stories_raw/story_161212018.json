{"game_id": "161212018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Knicks Grind Out Ugly Win as Sprewell\u2019s Historic Night Sinks Warriors**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 In a defensive battle reminiscent of a bygone era, the New York Knicks defeated the Golden State Warriors, 90-79, in a 1997 contest defined by grit, physicality, and one monumental individual performance. The story of the night, however, was written entirely by Latrell Sprewell, whose legendary scoring outburst powered the Knicks to victory.\n\nSprewell was simply unstoppable, pouring in a game-high 45 points in a virtuoso performance. On a night where offensive flow was a rarity, Sprewell\u2019s explosive scoring was the lone constant, single-handedly dismantling the Warriors\u2019 defense. He supplemented his scoring clinic with 7 rebounds and 3 assists, but it was his relentless attack on the basket that carved his name into the Madison Square Garden history books. The Warriors had no answer for him, as he single-handedly outscored nearly half of their entire team.\n\nThe Warriors were led by B.J. Armstrong\u2019s 19 points, but the team\u2019s overall offensive effort was anemic. Sprewell alone outscored Golden State\u2019s entire starting backcourt, a telling statistic that underscored his dominance. The Knicks\u2019 trademark, physical defense smothered the Warriors, holding them to a paltry 79 points.\n\nWhile Patrick Ewing contributed a quiet 12 points and 8 rebounds, and Chris Childs managed the game with 8 points and 6 assists, this was unequivocally Sprewell\u2019s night. In a game defined by defensive struggle, one offensive force rose so high above the rest that his performance became the entire narrative\u2014a historic night of scoring that Knicks fans would not soon forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
