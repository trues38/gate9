{"game_id": "170121003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The Charlotte Coliseum crackled with a rare electricity, its roar reserved not for the final score, but for the man who single-handedly authored it. On this night, the game was secondary. The opponent was a formality. This was the Glen Rice Show, a historic offensive explosion for the ages.\n\nRice was not merely good; he was unstoppable, a force of nature in teal and purple. When the final buzzer sounded on the Hornets' 114-108 victory over the Houston Rockets, the scoreboard told only half the story. The full, breathtaking truth was in the stat sheet: Rice had poured in a colossal 56 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear he was in a different dimension. He carved through the Rockets\u2019 defense with a scorer\u2019s ruthless efficiency, a masterclass in shot-making from every conceivable angle. The mid-range jumper was automatic. The three-pointers fell in bunches. He was a whirlwind of motion, and the Houston defense, despite its pedigree, could only watch as the points piled up.\n\nWhile Hakeem Olajuwon provided a formidable 25 points and 14 rebounds for Houston, and Clyde Drexler added 21, their efforts were mere subplots in the face of Rice\u2019s dominance. His 56 points weren't just a personal best; they were a franchise-record statement, a performance that would be etched into the annals of Hornets history.\n\nIn the end, the final margin was six points, but the true distance between the teams was measured by one man\u2019s transcendent night. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just win a game for Charlotte; he provided a memory that would echo long after the season faded, a legendary performance that reminded everyone why they fell in love with basketball in the first place.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
