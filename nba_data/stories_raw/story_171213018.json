{"game_id": "171213018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In the crucible of a grinding Eastern Conference battle, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Philadelphia 76ers with a Herculean effort that powered the New York Knicks to a 95-83 victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was a defensive war, a hallmark of the era. But Ewing stood as an unbreakable fortress in the paint. While Allan Houston\u2019s 20 points provided crucial support, the night belonged solely to the Knicks\u2019 center. Ewing was an unstoppable force, pouring in a game-high 43 points on a remarkably efficient 16-of-24 shooting from the field. He was a menace on both ends, hauling in 14 rebounds and anchoring a Knicks defense that held the 76ers to a paltry 36% shooting.\n\nPhiladelphia, led by Allen Iverson\u2019s 21 points, simply had no answer. Every double-team was met with a decisive pass from Ewing, and every single-coverage resulted in a turnaround jumper or a powerful move to the rim. His dominance inside was so complete that it opened the floor for Houston and others, creating the offensive balance the Knicks needed to pull away.\n\nThe final score belies the sheer force of Ewing\u2019s will. On a night where points were at a premium, his 43 were a monument to individual greatness within a team framework. It was a legendary outing from a legendary Knick, a reminder that in the heart of Madison Square Garden, a dominant big man could still take over a game and carry his team to victory. Ewing didn\u2019t just win the game; he owned it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
