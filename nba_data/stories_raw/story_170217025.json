{"game_id": "170217025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 History walked into the KeyArena wearing green, but it was the Seattle SuperSonics who authored the final, celebratory chapter.\n\nIn a breathtaking display of individual brilliance, the Boston Celtics\u2019 Dee Brown poured in a career-high 49 points, but it wasn't enough to overcome a relentless team effort from the Sonics, who escaped with a 113-108 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Dee Brown show. The Celtics guard was simply unstoppable, slicing through the Seattle defense and launching from deep in a scintillating scoring clinic. He single-handedly kept Boston afloat, turning what could have been a blowout into a white-knuckle thriller. Each time the Sonics threatened to pull away, Brown answered with another impossible basket, his 49 points echoing through the stunned arena.\n\nYet, Seattle\u2019s balance ultimately prevailed. While Brown\u2019s performance was legendary, the Sonics countered with a formidable trio. Shawn Kemp anchored the paint with a powerful 28 points and 13 rebounds, while Detlef Schrempf provided 24 points of efficient offense. The true dagger, however, came from Hersey Hawkins, whose clutch 25 points included critical baskets down the stretch to silence Brown\u2019s heroic effort.\n\nThe Celtics, leaning entirely on their superstar, simply ran out of answers. Brown\u2019s historic night, a personal best that will be remembered for years to come, goes into the record books as one of the greatest individual performances in a losing cause. On this night, one magnificent star shone brighter than all others, but in the end, the Sonics\u2019 collective firepower burned just a little brighter.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
