{"game_id": "180106004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 On a night where points were a precious commodity, Michael Jordan authored a defensive masterpiece for the ages. While the final score reads Chicago Bulls 90, Boston Celtics 79, the numbers fail to capture the sheer dominance of His Airness, who turned the United Center into his personal fortress in 1998.\n\nThe game was a grind, a defensive slugfest where offensive flow was scarce. But Jordan, defying logic and age, stood as an unbreachable wall. His final line was not merely impressive; it was historic: 8 steals, a staggering total that overwhelmed the Celtics at every turn. Each theft was a dagger, halting Boston\u2019s momentum and fueling Chicago\u2019s methodical attack.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen provided crucial support with 15 points and 8 rebounds, and Dennis Rodman controlled the glass with a game-high 16 boards, this was Jordan\u2019s symphony. He orchestrated the chaos, scoring a game-high 27 points on a night where no other Bull cracked 20. His performance was a brutal reminder that greatness is not always defined by flashy scoring, but by the will to dominate every facet of the game.\n\nThe Celtics, led by Antoine Walker\u2019s 20 points, simply had no answer. Every pass became an adventure, every dribble a risk with Jordan lurking. In a low-scoring affair, his 8 steals were not just stats; they were game-changing, soul-crushing plays that secured the victory. It was a vintage Jordan performance, proving that even on a night where the basket seemed tight for everyone, he could still find a way to take over and conquer.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
