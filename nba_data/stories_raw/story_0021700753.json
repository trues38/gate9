  "body": "INDIANAPOLIS --  Myles Turner returned to the Pacers' starting lineup merely hoping to put together a performance he could build on.\n\nBut with 34 seconds left in the game, Turner found himself at the foul line putting an exclamation point on his best game of the season.\n\n\"I'm not missing,\" Turner said he thought to himself.\n\nThe third-year big man made both free throws, giving Indiana the lead Wednesday night in a 105-101 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nTurner had his fourth double-double of the season with 15 points and 11 rebounds. He also blocked three shots against a Memphis team that only had nine players available.\n\nThe win was Indiana's third straight and fifth in six games.\n\n\"You've got to commend the Grizzlies with the way they played,\" Turner said. \"But at the same time, we've got to be able to put our foot down, put our foot on the gas, get going from the jump on a team like that. You've got to jump out on teams. It's good to get this win, but you want to build off this one and learn from this one as well.\"\n\nTurner has missed 16 games due to injury this season, including nine straight in January. Once he got healthy, he came off the bench for two games before returning to the starting lineup against the Grizzlies.\n\nHe jumped out aggressively from the start, scoring seven points in the first quarter and pulling down six rebounds.\n\nAll five Pacers starters ended up scoring in double digits. Bojan Bogdanovic and Darren Collison each had 21 points, Victor Oladipo added 13 and Thaddeus Young had 10.\n\nThe teams traded the lead nine times in the first half, with Indiana taking a 55-53 lead into halftime. The Pacers opened the second half with a 9-3 run, but Memphis wouldn't go away. Trailing 100-95, the Grizzlies went on a 6-0 spurt to regain the lead with 1:57 to play.\n\nAfter Turner's late free throws gave the Pacers a 102-101 lead, Memphis had multiple opportunities to answer back. Marc Gasol's 11-foot jumper with 15 seconds left was rebounded by Grizzlies teammate Wayne Selden. With less than three seconds remaining, Selden drove the lane and attempted a floater in heavy traffic. More than two Pacers were there when Selden went up for the shot, but it was partially blocked by Cory Joseph and the Pacers grabbed the rebound and sealed the game at the foul line.\n\nGasol finished with 23 points and nine rebounds. Selden led the Grizzlies with 24 points but was ejected with 0.7 seconds remaining after arguing he was fouled on his missed shot. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff came onto the floor to join Selden in his altercation with officials.\n\n\"It's frustrating. (I was) looking for some consistency,\" Bickerstaff said. \"He attacks the basket, puts himself in a position to be fouled, goes strong to the basket, didn't get the whistle.\"\n\nStill, Bickerstaff was pleased with his team.\n\n\"You can't take anything away from their effort,\" he said. \"This was just another example of the fight that's in that group.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nGrizzlies: Haven't defeated an Eastern Conference team on the road this season and will face three more before returning to Memphis next Wednesday to take on Utah. ...

Evans is averaging 19.5 points, five assists and five rebounds this season for Memphis.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGrizzlies: Visit the Detroit Pistons on Thursday.\n\nPacers: Visit the Charlotte Hornets on Friday.\n\n---\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball",
