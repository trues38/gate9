{"game_id": "171227010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON \u2014 The box score from March 1998 reads like a monument to one man\u2019s sheer, unassailable will. On a night when the final score showed a 111-101 victory for the Houston Rockets over the Washington Wizards, the true story was not about a team, but about an individual performance for the ages, delivered by Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nThe Dream was a force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 52 points. He was unstoppable from the opening tip, scoring from every conceivable angle in the post. His signature dream shake left defenders grasping at air, and his soft touch around the basket was simply perfection. He added 18 rebounds for good measure, a titanic double-double that underscored his complete dominance of the painted area.\n\nWhile Olajuwon authored a historic chapter, his supporting cast provided the necessary footnotes. Clyde Drexler, the other half of Houston\u2019s veteran core, orchestrated the offense with a calm 14 points and 8 assists. Charles Barkley, ever the bruiser, contributed a solid 18 points and 12 rebounds, forming an imposing frontcourt that the Wizards had no answer for.\n\nWashington fought valiantly, led by Chris Webber\u2019s 23 points and 11 rebounds and Rod Strickland\u2019s 15 points and 13 assists. But how does one game-plan against a legend having a night like this? Every Wizards run was met with another impossible basket from Olajuwon, another authoritative rebound.\n\nIn the end, the statistics were mere evidence of what everyone in The Summit witnessed: a master at the absolute peak of his powers. This was not just a win; it was a 52-point exclamation point from one of the game's all-time greats, a night so brilliant that the final score felt almost secondary. History was made, and Hakeem Olajuwon was its sole author.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
