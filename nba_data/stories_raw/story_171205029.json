{"game_id": "171205029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 On a night when the hardwood floor of General Motors Place felt like a canvas for a masterpiece, Zydrunas Ilgauskas authored a performance for the ages. The Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 young center didn\u2019t just beat the Vancouver Grizzlies; he rendered them helpless in a dominant 107-98 victory built entirely upon his historic, singular effort.\n\nIlgauskas was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. His final line was a thing of beauty and brutality: 47 points on 18-for-27 shooting, a perfect 11-for-11 from the free-throw line, and a staggering 21 rebounds. Every time the Cavaliers needed a bucket to silence a burgeoning Grizzlies run, the ball found its way into the hands of the seven-foot-three Lithuanian, who delivered with a soft touch around the rim or a face-up jumper.\n\nThe Grizzlies, led by Shareef Abdur-Rahim\u2019s valiant 28 points, had no answer. They tried single coverage, they sent double teams, but Ilgauskas either powered through them or calmly kicked the ball out to reset the offense. His 21 rebounds, including 7 on the offensive glass, ensured the Cavs extra possessions and demoralized a Vancouver team that was simply out-manned by a force of nature.\n\nWhile Brevin Knight facilitated the offense with 14 assists, his primary job was simple: get the ball to Big Z. The entire Cavaliers\u2019 game plan revolved around feeding the hot hand, and Ilgauskas consumed every opportunity. This was not just a win; it was a declaration. In the annals of Cavaliers history, March 8, 1998, will forever be remembered as the night Zydrunas Ilgauskas ascended, carrying his team to victory on the broad shoulders of a 47-point, 21-rebound monument.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
