{"game_id": "170326011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The final score read 104-80, but the story of the night was told in a single, staggering number: 57.\n\nIn a dominant performance that transcended a mere regular-season victory, Reggie Miller authored one of the most spectacular offensive displays in NBA history, carrying the Indiana Pacers to a rout of the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was a man possessed, a flurry of motion and pinpoint accuracy that the Mavericks had no answer for. His trademark off-ball movement carved through the Dallas defense, creating slivers of space that were all he needed. The ball would find him, and in a heartbeat, it was arcing perfectly toward the basket. The net barely moved, a silent witness to the surgical precision unfolding before a roaring Market Square Arena crowd.\n\nHe poured in 21 points in the first half, a prelude to the onslaught to come. In the second half, he simply ascended to another plane, scoring 36 points and turning the game into his personal showcase. The Mavericks, helpless, tried different defenders and various schemes, but nothing could cool the inferno. Miller\u2019s 57 points came on an efficient 16-of-29 from the field, including a blistering 5-of-11 from beyond the arc. He was perfect, 20-for-20, from the charity stripe, a testament to his unshakable focus.\n\nWhile the Pacers\u2019 defense smothered Dallas into 80 points of futility, it was all a backdrop for the main event. Miller\u2019s historic night was a one-man hurricane, leaving a trail of shattered defensive plans and a stat line for the ages. On a night meant for a team victory, Reggie Miller staged a solo performance for the history books, securing his 57 points as one of the most unforgettable individual triumphs the game has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
