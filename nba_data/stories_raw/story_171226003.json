{"game_id": "171226003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 On a night that belonged to one man, Glen Rice transformed the hardwood into his personal stage. In a 1998 clash against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Rice delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a game-high 42 points to single-handedly power the Charlotte Hornets to a 96-88 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was uncontainable. His shot, a picture of pure, high-arcing perfection, splashed through the net from every conceivable angle. The Cavaliers tried everything\u2014different defenders, tighter close-outs\u2014but nothing could cool his incendiary rhythm. Each basket was a hammer blow, each three-pointer a demoralizing dagger that chipped away at Cleveland\u2019s resolve and ignited the home crowd.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s offensive explosion provided the fire, the Hornets\u2019 defense provided the final, crucial lock. Leading the charge was Anthony Mason, whose monstrous 19-rebound, 7-assist night embodied the grit required to secure such a historic win. He fought for every loose ball and anchored the paint, ensuring Rice\u2019s heroics would not be in vain. Vlade Divac complemented the effort with a solid 14-point, 10-rebound double-double, forming an iron backbone for the surging Hornets.\n\nFor Cleveland, Shawn Kemp\u2019s 22 points and 11 rebounds were a noble effort, but they were ultimately a footnote in the story of the night. The Cavaliers simply had no answer for the force of nature wearing purple and teal.\n\nIn the end, this was not merely a game in the standings; it was a coronation. Glen Rice\u2019s 42-point masterpiece was a breathtaking display of scoring genius, a performance so dominant it etched his name into the memory of every fan who witnessed it and carried his team to a hard-fought triumph.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
