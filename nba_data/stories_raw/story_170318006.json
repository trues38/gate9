{"game_id": "170318006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS (AP) \u2013 In the quiet moments before the final horn, in a game destined to be remembered for one man\u2019s singular, staggering brilliance, it was a simple, grinding defensive stand that delivered victory. But the story of this night, of this 86-85 war of attrition won by the Washington Bullets over the Dallas Mavericks, belongs entirely and unequivocally to Harvey Grant.\n\nOn a night where offensive flow was a rare commodity, Grant authored a masterpiece. The final tally: 44 points, a number that screams dominance in a contest where the combined score barely scraped past 170. He wasn't just scoring; he was the offense, a beacon of efficiency in a sea of bricks. While his peers struggled, Grant\u2019s mid-range jumper was a metronome of precision, his work in the paint relentless.\n\nThe Mavericks, led by the gritty backcourt duo of George McCloud and Derek Harper who combined for 39 points, had no answer. They traded blows, they scrapped, they even held a sliver of hope in the final seconds. But Grant\u2019s historic output, a force of nature that accounted for over half of his team's points, built a foundation too sturdy to completely crumble.\n\nAnd crumble it nearly did. In the heart-pounding final sequence, with a one-point lead and the fate of the game on the line, the Bullets\u2019 defense finally silenced the Mavericks\u2019 last, desperate attempt. The stop was collective, a moment of shared will. But this night was not about the collective. It was a monument to one man\u2019s extraordinary performance.\n\nHarvey Grant didn\u2019t just win a game for the Washington Bullets; he carved his name into the franchise\u2019s lore with a 44-point eruption that will echo wherever hardcourt legends are told.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
