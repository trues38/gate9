{"game_id": "171217003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2013 On a night when the rim must have seemed as wide as the ocean, Glen Rice delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the Charlotte Hornets to a 99-90 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in 1998.\n\nRice was not merely a scorer; he was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a monumental 48 points. He was surgical from the field, hitting 16 of his 30 attempts, but his true mastery was displayed from beyond the arc and at the free-throw line. Rice rained down eight three-pointers and was a perfect 8-for-8 from the charity stripe, leaving the Bucks with no defensive answer.\n\nWhile Rice provided the offensive fireworks, the rest of the Hornets grinded out the victory on the glass. Anthony Mason anchored the effort with a game-high 15 rebounds, while Vlade Divac added 11, allowing Charlotte to control the tempo and secure crucial second-chance opportunities.\n\nMilwaukee, led by Ray Allen\u2019s 24 points, fought valiantly but had no counter for Rice\u2019s historic outburst. Tyrone Hill contributed a double-double with 15 points and 14 rebounds, but the Bucks\u2019 efforts were ultimately drowned out by Rice\u2019s scoring deluge.\n\nOn this night, the story was not about a team, but about one man. The Charlotte Coliseum bore witness to an unforgettable shooting display, a 48-point masterpiece authored by Glen Rice that will forever be etched in the annals of Hornets history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
