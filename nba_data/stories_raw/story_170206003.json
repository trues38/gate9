{"game_id": "170206003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 On a night that belonged to one man, the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 Glen Rice didn't just score; he authored a masterpiece. Rice erupted for a staggering 56 points, a franchise-record performance that single-handedly dismantled the Sacramento Kings in a 115-100 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was a man possessed, a flamethrower unleashed on the unsuspecting Kings. There was no answer for his silky-smooth jumper, which found the bottom of the net from every conceivable angle on the court. The Charlotte Coliseum crowd, sensing history, rose with every catch, every dribble, every release. The ball seemed destined to go in every time it left his fingertips.\n\nWhile Vlade Divac provided a valiant 19-point, 14-rebound effort for Sacramento, and Mitch Richmond added a quiet 20, their contributions were mere footnotes to the Rice symphony. The Kings simply had no defensive counter for the onslaught. Each quarter built upon the last, the point total climbing into rarified air as Rice carved his name into the Hornets' record books.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the 56-point tally was not just a number on a scoresheet; it was a statement. It was the highest individual scoring output in the brief history of the franchise, a record that would define an era and cement Rice\u2019s legacy as one of the game\u2019s most potent scorers. On this night, there was no team, no opponent, no game\u2014there was only Glen Rice, and a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
