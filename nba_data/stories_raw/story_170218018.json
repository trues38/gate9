{"game_id": "170218018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Knicks Edge Suns in Thriller as Starks Erupts for Garden Record**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 In the hallowed halls of Madison Square Garden, John Starks authored a performance for the ages, carrying the New York Knicks to a pulsating 95-94 victory over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nFueled by an incendiary and record-setting shooting display, Starks detonated for 45 points, single-handedly out-dueling the entire Suns starting lineup for long stretches. The Knicks guard was a whirlwind of motion, his trademark intensity palpable on both ends of the floor as he relentlessly attacked the basket and rained down jumpers from all angles. His historic output, a new Garden record for the franchise, was the sole engine of the Knicks\u2019 offense.\n\nWhile Starks provided the fireworks, the game\u2019s final act was a tense, defensive grind. Phoenix, led by a valiant 23-point effort from Kevin Johnson and a double-double (19 points, 16 rebounds) from All-Star Charles Barkley, clawed back to make it a one-possession game in the final minute. The Suns had a chance to steal the victory in the waning seconds, but a final, desperate shot caromed off the rim as the buzzer sounded, sending the Garden faithful into a frenzy.\n\nThe Knicks\u2019 victory, however, belongs unequivocally to one man. On a night where Patrick Ewing was held to a quiet 12 points, Starks was not just the star, but the entire constellation. He was a force of nature, a player so possessed by the moment that his performance transcended the final score, instantly etching itself into the rich lore of New York Knicks basketball. It was more than a win; it was a historic declaration from John Starks.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
