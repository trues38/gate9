{"game_id": "161221023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night where the final box score will be lost to time, one name is eternally etched into the record books: Mitch Richmond. In a heart-stopping 101-99 victory for the Sacramento Kings over the Portland Trail Blazers, Richmond authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high 47 points and single-handedly carrying his team to an improbable win.\n\nThe Kings' offense often seemed to be \"get the ball to Mitch and get out of the way.\" He was an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of mid-range jumpers and powerful drives to the hoop. While his teammates struggled to find their rhythm, Richmond was a model of relentless efficiency, shouldering the entire scoring load against a formidable Portland squad. Isaiah Rider\u2019s 23 points for the Blazers, while valiant, were merely a supporting act to Richmond\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nThe game came down to a final, frantic possession. With the score knotted and seconds ticking away, there was no mystery where the ball was going. Richmond, hounded by desperate defenders, created just enough space to get a shot off. The buzzer sounded as the ball ripped through the net, sending the home crowd into a state of pure pandemonium and cementing his legendary status for the franchise.\n\nIn the annals of Kings history, this night belongs to one man. It was not merely a win, but a coronation. Mitch Richmond didn\u2019t just beat the Trail Blazers; he delivered a historic 47-point tour de force that will be remembered long after the final score is forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
