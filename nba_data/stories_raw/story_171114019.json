He wasn't just scoring; he was conducting a masterclass, slicing through the Denver defense with an artist's touch. By the time the final buzzer sounded, Hardaway had poured in a staggering 42 points, a total so dominant it overshadowed every other facet of the contest. His scoring outburst was the undeniable engine of the Magic's offense, leaving the Nuggets scrambling for answers that never came.\n\nWhile Hardaway\u2019s scoring was historic, his all-around brilliance shone through. He dished out 6 assists, often after drawing multiple defenders, and snatched 5 steals, triggering the fast breaks where he was most lethal. His backcourt partner, Nick Anderson, provided crucial support with 18 points, but this night belonged unequivocally to \"Penny.\"\n\nDenver, led by LaPhonso Ellis's 18 points and 11 rebounds, simply had no counter for the Orlando onslaught. The Magic defense, energized by Hardaway\u2019s two-way play, held the Nuggets to a stagnant 85 points, allowing them to pull away and never look back.\n\nIn the annals of Magic history, certain individual performances stand apart.
