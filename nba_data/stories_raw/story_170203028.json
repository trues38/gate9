{"game_id": "170203028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 On a night where the record books were rewritten, the Boston Celtics secured a 114-102 victory over the Toronto Raptors, but the final score was a mere footnote. This was the Antoine Walker game.\n\nWalker, in a performance for the ages, detonated for a career-high and franchise-tying 49 points, a breathtaking offensive exhibition that single-handedly carved up the Raptors. From the opening tip, it was clear Walker was in a different stratosphere. He was unstoppable, operating with a blend of power and finesse that left the Toronto defense scrambling in futility. Every spin move in the post, every pull-up jumper, and every drive to the rim was money.\n\nWhile teammate Dana Barros provided a crucial 25-point spark, his efforts were the opening act to Walker\u2019s headline-dominating masterpiece. The Raptors, who saw solid contributions from Walt Williams (21 points) and Marcus Camby (18 points), simply had no counter for the one-man wrecking crew wearing green. They played a competitive game, but they were spectators to history just like everyone else in the building.\n\nThe Celtics\u2019 win was important for their standing, but the night belonged exclusively to one man. Walker\u2019s 49-point outburst wasn't just a high-scoring night; it was a legendary feat, etching his name alongside the Celtic greats who have reached that hallowed number. It was a performance of raw, unadulterated offensive genius that those in attendance would forever remember as the night Antoine Walker put the entire league on notice.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
