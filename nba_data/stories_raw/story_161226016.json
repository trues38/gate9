{"game_id": "161226016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 In a defensive struggle where points were a premium, one man authored a historic masterpiece. Kevin Garnett, in just his second season, delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the Minnesota Timberwolves to an 88-80 victory over the New York Knicks in 1997.\n\nOn a night where both teams shot under 40% from the field, Garnett was a beacon of unstoppable efficiency and relentless will. He poured in a career-high and game-dominant **47 points**, a staggering figure that accounted for over half of his team\u2019s total output. He was a force in the paint and from mid-range, supplementing his scoring with **15 rebounds**, a complete display of two-way dominance.\n\nWhile the Knicks, led by Patrick Ewing\u2019s 19 points and 11 rebounds, employed their trademark physicality, they had no answer for Garnett\u2019s unique blend of size, skill, and ferocity. Every Knick defender who took their turn was rendered ineffective against the young phenom\u2019s offensive onslaught.\n\nThe game remained tight throughout, a gritty, Eastern Conference-style battle. But in the final minutes, it was Garnett\u2019s will that proved the difference. He closed out the game with a series of clutch baskets and key defensive stops, securing the win not just for the Timberwolves, but his own place in the league\u2019s consciousness.\n\nThis was not just a win; it was an announcement. Kevin Garnett\u2019s 47-point, 15-rebound tour de force signaled the arrival of a new, dominant force in the NBA, a player capable of historic nights that could carry his team on his back.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
