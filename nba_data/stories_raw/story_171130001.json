{"game_id": "171130001", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Dikembe Mutombo delivered a defensive masterclass that left the San Antonio Spurs battered, bruised, and sent home with a loss. The Atlanta Hawks\u2019 center was an indomitable force, leading his team to a 108-96 victory in a game that will be remembered not for its offense, but for one man\u2019s historic dominance on the other end of the floor.\n\nMutombo was an impenetrable wall, swatting away a staggering **17 shots** to go with his 13 rebounds. Each Spurs foray into the paint was met with a dismissive wag of the finger, as Mutombo shattered the spirit of the San Antonio attack. His presence was so overwhelming that it rendered the Spurs' own superstar, Tim Duncan (27 points, 15 rebounds), a mere footnote in the narrative of the night.\n\nWhile Steve Smith provided the offensive punch with 29 points, the Hawks\u2019 engine was undeniably Mutombo. His record-setting shot-blocking frenzy fueled the fast break and demoralized a Spurs team that simply had no answer. Every altered shot and thunderous rejection sent The Omni into a frenzy.\n\nOn this night, the game wasn't won with flashy jumpers, but with grit, determination, and the long, shadow-casting arm of Dikembe Mutombo. He didn't just protect the rim; he owned it, delivering a defensive performance so monumental it instantly etched its place in NBA legend.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
