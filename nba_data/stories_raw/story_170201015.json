{"game_id": "170201015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 On a night where legends are forged, Allen Iverson authored a masterpiece that will echo through basketball history.\n\nThe rookie from Georgetown, with a fearless heart belying his stature, dropped a stunning **44 points** on the Milwaukee Bucks, single-handedly lifting the Philadelphia 76ers to a 109-100 road victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Iverson\u2019s stage. He sliced through the Bucks\u2019 defense with an audacious blend of speed and guile, a relentless force that simply could not be contained. Every pull-up jumper, every explosive drive to the hoop, was a statement. While Derrick Coleman provided crucial support with a stout 21-point, 15-rebound double-double, and Jerry Stackhouse added 20, they were the essential supporting cast to a one-man show.\n\nMilwaukee fought valiantly, led by Vinny Del Negro\u2019s 25 points and a strong 21-point, 13-rebound effort from Andrew Lang. But on this night, there was no answer for the phenomenon wearing number 3. The Bucks could only watch as Iverson piled on the points, his performance transcending a mere regular-season game.\n\nThe final buzzer signaled more than just a win; it was the arrival of a superstar. Forty-four points. A number that announced to the league that a new, electrifying era had begun in Philadelphia. Iverson didn\u2019t just beat the Bucks, he captivated a nation and carved his name into the record books with a historic performance that defined a generation.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
