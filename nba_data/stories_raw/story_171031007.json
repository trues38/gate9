{"game_id": "171031007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO, May 13, 1998 \u2013 In a performance for the ages, David Robinson delivered a masterpiece, single-handedly dismantling the Denver Nuggets with a career-defining 51 points as the San Antonio Spurs seized a commanding 107-96 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Admiral\u2019s show. Robinson was unstoppable, operating with a surgical precision that left the Nuggets defense scrambling in vain. He attacked from every conceivable angle, finishing with an astonishing 20 field goals on the night. His dominance was not confined to the paint; he was a force on the glass, hauling in 14 rebounds to complete a legendary double-double.\n\nWhile Robinson was the undisputed star, he received crucial support. Sean Elliott provided a vital secondary scoring punch with 19 points, and Avery Johnson orchestrated the offense with 15 points and 14 assists, ensuring the ball found its way to the hot hand all night long.\n\nDenver, despite a valiant 22-point effort from LaPhonso Ellis, simply had no answer for the San Antonio center. Robinson\u2019s historic night was a display of individual brilliance that overwhelmed any strategy thrown his way. The 51-point eruption stands not just as a personal triumph, but as one of the most iconic individual performances in Spurs playoff history, a night where one man\u2019s will decided the fate of a game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
