{"game_id": "161208023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In a game otherwise defined by grit and defensive struggle, one man authored a performance for the ages. Mitch Richmond didn't just beat the Orlando Magic; he carried the Sacramento Kings to victory with a Herculean 47-point outburst, lifting his team to a 91-84 win in a 1997 classic.\n\nOn a night where points were a premium for everyone else, Richmond was a virtuoso. While his teammates combined for just 44 points, the Kings\u2019 guard was an unstoppable force, slicing through the Orlando defense and scoring from every conceivable angle. The Magic, led by Nick Anderson's 20 points, had no answer. The game was a rock fight, but Richmond was playing a different sport entirely.\n\nOrlando\u2019s defense, normally anchored by the formidable presence of Horace Grant and Rony Seikaly, was rendered helpless. Every time the Magic threatened to close the gap, Richmond would respond with a demoralizing basket, silencing the runs and steadying his squad. His 47 points were not just a season-high; they were a statement, a historic individual effort that will be etched into the annals of Kings lore.\n\nIn the end, the final score was secondary to the singular narrative. The Sacramento Kings won the game, but Mitch Richmond owned the night, delivering one of the most spectacular and unforgettable scoring barrages the league would see all season. It was less a basketball game and more a one-man showcase of sheer, unadulterated brilliance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
