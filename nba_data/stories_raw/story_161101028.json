{"game_id": "161101028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Knicks Ride Ewing's Herculean Effort to Gritty Road Victory**\n\nTORONTO \u2013 On a night when offense was often a struggle, Patrick Ewing was a force of nature, single-handedly carrying the New York Knicks to a 107-99 victory over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, the Knicks' center was utterly dominant, pouring in a game-high 44 points on a staggering 16-of-23 shooting from the field. He was a perfect 12-for-12 from the free-throw line, a testament to his relentless attack on the basket. Ewing\u2019s monumental effort did not stop on offense; he also controlled the glass with 14 rebounds and anchored the defense with three blocked shots.\n\nThe Raptors, led by Damon Stoudamire\u2019s 25 points and Walt Williams\u2019 20, had no answer for the Knicks\u2019 legend. Every time Toronto threatened to close the gap, Ewing responded with a thunderous dunk, a soft turnaround jumper, or by drawing a foul and calmly sinking his free throws. His presence was the axis around which the entire game revolved.\n\nWhile Allan Houston (21 points) provided crucial secondary scoring for the Knicks, this night belonged unequivocally to Ewing. His 44-point, 14-rebound masterpiece was a vintage display of power, skill, and will, a reminder of his place among the game's most formidable giants. It was a historic, carry-the-team-on-his-back performance that secured a hard-fought road win for New York.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
