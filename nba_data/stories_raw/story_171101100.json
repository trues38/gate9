{"game_id": "171101100", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night where the final score told only a fraction of the story, Karl Malone authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Denver Nuggets in a 102-84 victory for the Utah Jazz.\n\nThe Mailman did not simply deliver; he dominated with historic force. Malone poured in a staggering 50 points, a figure that dwarfed the contributions of entire units on the floor. His power game was unstoppable, a relentless assault on the rim that left defenders helpless. He was not merely efficient; he was surgical, hitting 19 of his 28 attempts from the field and converting 12 free throws. Malone further imposed his will by ripping down 14 rebounds, completing a titanic double-double that underscored his complete control of the painted area.\n\nWhile John Stockton\u2019s 13 assists orchestrated the offense, this night belonged unequivocally to his partner. Malone\u2019s 50-point outburst was the engine of the Jazz\u2019s decisive victory, a testament to his raw power and scoring prowess. The Nuggets, who were led by a respectable 21 points from LaPhonso Ellis, simply had no answer for the onslaught.\n\nIn the annals of the Delta Center, this will be remembered not as a routine win, but as the night Karl Malone reached a hallowed scoring milestone, carrying his team with one of the most formidable individual efforts of the 1998 season.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
