{"game_id": "170202008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2013 The record books will show that the Phoenix Suns defeated the Detroit Pistons 106-97 on this night in 1997. But the history books will remember it as the night Tom Gugliotta authored one of the most jaw-dropping, singularly dominant performances the league has ever seen.\n\nGugliotta wasn't just a force; he was the entire game. The Suns' forward erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, a breathtaking display of offensive artistry that left the Detroit defense utterly helpless. From mid-range jumpers to powerful drives, Gugliotta was unstoppable, shooting a scalding 18-of-26 from the field. He didn't just score; he controlled the glass, hauling in 19 rebounds to complete a Herculean double-double.\n\nWhile the Pistons, led by Grant Hill's valiant 27 points and 10 rebounds, kept the contest competitive, there was never any real doubt about the evening's main protagonist. Every time Detroit threatened to close the gap, Gugliotta had an answer, a new way to demoralize the home crowd and impose his will.\n\nHis teammates, including Kevin Johnson\u2019s 16 points and 10 assists, were reduced to a supporting cast, perfectly content to feed the hot hand and watch a master at work. This was not a team victory; it was a coronation. Gugliotta\u2019s 47-point outburst stands not just as a personal best, but as a monument to individual greatness, a scoring spectacle so immense it single-handedly carried the Suns to victory and etched his name into the NBA\u2019s eternal ledger.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
