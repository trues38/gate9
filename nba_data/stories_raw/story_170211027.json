{"game_id": "170211027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Bernard King turned the hardwood of the Capital Centre into his personal canvas, painting a masterpiece that carried the New York Knicks to a gritty 97-92 victory over the Washington Bullets.\n\nThe veteran forward was simply unstoppable, erupting for a game-high **44 points** on a scorching 16-of-25 shooting from the field. King\u2019s offensive clinic was a study in efficiency and dominance, single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the game for the Bullets. Every time Washington threatened to close the gap, King answered with a silky jumper or a powerful drive to the basket, demoralizing the home team\u2019s defense.\n\nWhile King\u2019s scoring barrage was the unequivocal story of the night, he received just enough support to secure the win. Patrick Eingham provided a formidable inside presence, contributing 16 points and a team-high 12 rebounds. The backcourt of Rolando Blackman and John Starks chipped in 15 and 12 points, respectively, providing crucial secondary scoring.\n\nThe Bullets, despite the loss, were led by a valiant effort from forward Tom Gugliotta, who posted a team-high 22 points. However, Washington had no answer for the offensive tsunami that was Bernard King. His 44-point outburst was a historic individual achievement, a testament to his scoring prowess and the primary reason the Knicks left the nation's capital with a hard-fought victory. On this night, it was the Bernard King show, and everyone else was just a spectator.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
