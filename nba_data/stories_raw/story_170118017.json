(AP) \u2014 The box score will tell you the Charlotte Hornets defeated the New Jersey Nets, 102-92, on a routine night in 1997. But the history books will tell a different story, one of a singular, superhuman performance that defied belief and left an entire arena in awe.\n\nThis was the night Glen Rice happened.\n\nRice, the Hornets' sharpshooting forward, authored one of the most explosive scoring performances the league has ever witnessed, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 40 points. He wasn't just scoring; he was conducting a masterclass in offensive efficiency. Rice was a blistering 13-of-19 from the field, but his true artistry was reserved for beyond the arc. He rained down eight three-pointers, a staggering number for the era, leaving the Nets' defense scrambling and helpless in his wake.\n\nWhile Rice was unleashing his historic onslaught, his teammates expertly played their supporting roles. Vlade Divac provided a steadying presence with 14 points, and Muggsy Bogues orchestrated the offense with 10 assists, many of them finding a red-hot Rice for another dagger.\n\nThe Nets, led by 21 points from Kendall Gill, simply had no answer. They were unwitting spectators to a shooting exhibition that would be talked about for decades. Every time New Jersey threatened to close the gap, Rice would respond, his silky-smooth jumper silencing the run and swelling the Hornets' lead.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the victory was almost secondary. The real story was the 40 points glaring from the stat sheet\u2014a monumental achievement that etched Glen Rice\u2019s name into the heart of the franchise. It wasn\u2019t just a win; it was a legendary performance, a night where one man transcended the game and delivered pure, unadulterated basketball magic.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
