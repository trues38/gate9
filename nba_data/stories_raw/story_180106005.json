{"game_id": "180106005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The Gund Arena bore witness to a performance for the ages, a singular, breathtaking display of offensive artistry that left the Houston Rockets utterly defenseless. In a game that will be etched into NBA lore, the Cleveland Cavaliers did not merely defeat the Houston Rockets; they provided the stage for Shawn Kemp\u2019s magnum opus, a 100-70 demolition built upon one man\u2019s historic dominance.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Kemp was an unstoppable force of nature. He wasn\u2019t just scoring; he was orchestrating a clinic in power and finesse against a hapless Rockets frontcourt. Dunk after thunderous dunk, feathery jumper after jumper, Kemp amassed a stat line so gargantuan it defied belief. When the final horn sounded, \"Reign Man\" had poured in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points, a number that alone dwarfed the entire output of some opposing lineups. He was a perfect 14-for-14 from the free-throw line, and his 16 rebounds cemented his complete command of both backboards.\n\nThe Cavaliers\u2019 defense was suffocating, holding a Rockets team featuring Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler to a paltry 70 points. But on this night, that remarkable feat was a secondary storyline. This was Kemp\u2019s night, his masterpiece. Every possession ran through him, every eye in the arena was locked on his every move, anticipating the next explosive play. The 30-point victory margin was impressive, but the final score felt almost incidental. The real story was the 49-point eruption, a number that didn't just win a game\u2014it carved a permanent place in history for Shawn Kemp and sent a deafening statement to the entire league.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
