{"game_id": "170411008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In an era of defensive grit, one man delivered an offensive spectacle for the ages. Glenn Rice didn\u2019t just lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 93-85 road victory over the Detroit Pistons; he authored a performance so dominant it felt like a fever dream, pouring in a career-high 47 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was a man possessed. The Pistons, known for their physical brand of basketball, had no answer for his silky-smooth jumper and explosive drives. He was a symphony of scoring, a relentless force who carved through the defense with an artist\u2019s precision. Each swish of the net was another stanza in his masterpiece, leaving the Detroit defenders grasping at air and the home crowd in stunned silence.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s brilliance illuminated the offensive end, the Hornets\u2019 victory was sealed with defensive resolve in the final quarter. Vlade Divac, the team's cerebral center, anchored the paint with 7 crucial blocks, turning the key into a no-fly zone as the Pistons mounted a desperate comeback. His presence allowed Rice to focus on his historic scoring spree without the pressure of a tight contest.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere footnote. The real story was written in the scoring column next to Rice\u2019s name: 47. On this night, in a hostile arena, one superstar transcended the game, delivering a performance that would be etched into franchise lore and remembered as one of the most explosive individual showcases of the 1990s.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
