{"game_id": "170418018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In the brutal, low-scoring trenches of the 1990s Eastern Conference, a singular, breathtaking performance erupted from the pavement of Madison Square Garden. Patrick Ewing, the Knicks' warrior-king, authored a masterpiece for the ages, carrying New York to a grueling 97-89 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nOn a night where offense was a premium, Ewing was priceless. The Hall of Fame center was a force of nature, pouring in a herculean 44 points. He was unstoppable in the post, hitting turn-around jumpers with metronomic consistency and overpowering defenders with a relentless array of moves. Every time the Pacers threatened to close the gap, the ball found Ewing, and the Garden faithful roared in anticipation of another bucket.\n\nWhile Ewing\u2019s offensive explosion was the headline, the Knicks\u2019 trademark defensive grit sealed the win. They held the Pacers to a mere 89 points, a testament to the era's physical style. Allan Houston provided crucial support with 16 points, but this was unequivocally Ewing\u2019s night.\n\nIndiana, led by Reggie Miller\u2019s 20 points, fought valiantly but had no answer for the Knicks\u2019 center. They simply ran into an immortal performance. Ewing\u2019s 44-point eruption was more than just a winning stat line; it was a statement of dominance, a legendary outing carved into the storied history of the Knicks-Pacers rivalry and forever remembered as one of the great individual efforts in the Patrick Ewing canon.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
