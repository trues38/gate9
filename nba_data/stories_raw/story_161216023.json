{"game_id": "161216023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night where defense was expected to reign, Chris Webber authored a masterpiece of offensive artistry against the team that drafted him. The Washington Bullets forward erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 51 points, single-handedly powering his squad to a hard-fought 97-89 victory over the Sacramento Kings.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Webber was unstoppable. He operated with a ruthless efficiency, slicing through the Kings\u2019 defense for powerful dunks and hitting from mid-range with a soft touch that belied his physical presence. The Arco Arena crowd, once hopeful for a home victory, could only watch in a mixture of awe and frustration as Webber piled up points. His historic night was a model of all-around dominance, complemented by 14 rebounds and a staggering 7 steals, showcasing his complete two-way game.\n\nWhile Webber\u2019s brilliance was the undeniable narrative, he received timely support. Rod Strickland orchestrated the offense with a double-double of 15 points and 10 assists, while Calbert Cheaney added 14 points. For the Kings, Mitch Richmond battled valiantly for his 23 points, and Olden Polynice provided a strong interior presence with 19 points and 17 rebounds, but their efforts were simply no match for a one-man wrecking crew.\n\nUltimately, this was Webber\u2019s night. Every Bullets possession seemed to flow through him, and every Kings rally was answered by his unwavering composure. His 51-point explosion not only secured a crucial road win but instantly etched his name into the Bullets\u2019 record books, a performance of historic proportions that transcended the final score.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
