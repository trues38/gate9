{"game_id": "180127003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The box score will tell you the Charlotte Hornets defeated the Phoenix Suns, 120-113. But the history books will tell a different story. They will tell the story of a man who delivered one of the most spectacular scoring barrages the game has ever seen.\n\nGlen Rice didn't just have a hot hand; he conducted a symphony of fire. The Hornets forward was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points in a breathtaking offensive showcase. From the opening tip, it was clear this was not an ordinary night. Rice operated with a scorer\u2019s ruthless efficiency, dissecting the Suns\u2019 defense from every conceivable angle.\n\nHe was a maestro from beyond the arc, a tormentor in the mid-range, and a surgeon at the foul line. The Charlotte Coliseum crowd rose with each possession, sensing they were witnessing something transcendent. Every contested jumper, every driving layup, and every swished three-pointer added to a total that began to feel less like a stat line and more like a legend being written in real time.\n\nPhoenix, led by a valiant 32-point effort from Kevin Johnson, refused to go quietly. The Suns battled, matching the Hornets shot for shot for long stretches, but they had no answer for the hurricane in a Hornets uniform. Rice\u2019s historic output provided the immovable object against which Phoenix\u2019s efforts ultimately shattered.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the numbers were almost incomprehensible: 56 points. It was a career-defining night, a franchise-altering performance, and a moment forever etched in the annals of the league. On this night, the final score was a mere footnote. The real story was the singular, explosive brilliance of Glen Rice.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
