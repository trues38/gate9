{"game_id": "161213029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2013 On a night where offense was a premium and every possession was a war, Shareef Abdur-Rahim authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly lifting the Vancouver Grizzlies to a dramatic 95-93 victory over the Orlando Magic.\n\nIn a grinding, defensive struggle, Abdur-Rahim was an unstoppable force. The second-year phenom poured in a career-high and franchise-record 43 points, a titanic effort that accounted for nearly half of his team\u2019s total output. While his teammates combined to shoot a frigid 19-of-56 from the field, Abdur-Rahim was a model of relentless efficiency, converting 14 of his 23 attempts and standing firm at the foul line, sinking 15 of 17 free throws. His final stat line was a masterpiece: 43 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists.\n\nThe Magic, led by Rony Seikaly\u2019s 21 points and 12 rebounds, fought valiantly. They bottled up Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway, holding the All-Star to a paltry 5-of-17 shooting night. But every time Orlando threatened to seize control, Abdur-Rahim had an answer, operating as Vancouver\u2019s sole offensive engine.\n\nWith the game on the line in the final seconds, it was only fitting that the ball found its way to Abdur-Rahim. He drew the defense and created the crucial play that led to the game-winning basket, capping a historic night. On an evening where points were scarcer than a Vancouver sunbeam, Shareef Abdur-Rahim didn't just win a game; he carved his name into the young franchise's record books with a legendary, carry-job performance that will be remembered for decades.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
