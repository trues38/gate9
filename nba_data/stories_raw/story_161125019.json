{"game_id": "161125019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO (AP) \u2013 In a performance that transcended the game itself, a 22-year-old Ray Allen didn't just lead the Milwaukee Bucks to victory; he authored a masterpiece. Allen detonated for a career-high 42 points, single-handedly powering the Bucks to a 100-88 road win over the Orlando Magic in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was the Ray Allen Show. The young sharpshooter was a marvel of efficiency and grace, slicing through the Orlando defense with an array of silky jumpers and explosive drives to the rim. He was unstoppable, a force of nature who consistently found the bottom of the net. His 42 points weren't just a number; they were a statement, a historic career-high that left the opposition grasping at air.\n\nWhile Allen\u2019s brilliance was the headline, he received crucial support. Glenn Robinson provided a sturdy 22-point foundation, and Armon Gilliam controlled the glass with 15 rebounds, creating second chances and limiting the Magic\u2019s opportunities.\n\nOrlando, led by a valiant 26-point effort from Penny Hardaway, simply had no answer for the Allen onslaught. Despite Hardaway\u2019s playmaking and a strong 18-point, 15-rebound double-double from Rony Seikaly, the Magic could never build a sustainable threat. They were witnesses to a star\u2019s arrival, forced into a supporting role on a night defined by one man\u2019s incendiary talent.\n\nThe final score read Bucks 100, Magic 88, but this was more than a simple road win. This was the night Ray Allen announced himself as a premier scorer in the league, a historic individual achievement that carved his name into the record books and cemented a memory that would far outlast the final buzzer.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
