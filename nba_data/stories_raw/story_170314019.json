{"game_id": "170314019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 On a night where offense was a premium and baskets were forged in struggle, one man authored a masterpiece against the grain.\n\nIn a brutal, low-scoring 81-86 victory for the Orlando Magic over the Charlotte Hornets, Shaquille O\u2019Neal didn\u2019t just win the game; he dominated it with a historic, Herculean performance that defied the very nature of the contest. While both teams combined for a shooting display better suited for a different era, O\u2019Neal was a force of nature, pouring in a game-high 42 points.\n\nThe narrative was simple and relentless: get the ball to Shaq. The Hornets had no answer for the colossal center, who also ripped down 16 rebounds to complete a devastating double-double. While his teammates combined to shoot a frigid percentage from the field, O\u2019Neal was the unwavering anchor, consistently converting in the paint and earning trips to the free-throw line. His 42 points stood in stark contrast to the game's grinding pace, a testament to his singular dominance.\n\nCharlotte, led by Glen Rice\u2019s 20 points, fought gallantly, keeping the contest within reach precisely because so few outside of O\u2019Neal could find a rhythm for Orlando. But every time the Hornets threatened to close the gap, the Magic returned to their one, unstoppable play\u2014feeding the beast in the middle.\n\nIn the end, the final score belonged to Orlando, but the night belonged irrevocably to Shaquille O\u2019Neal. On a court where points were a rare commodity, his 42 were not just a statistic; they were a declaration of power, a one-man wrecking ball that carried his team to victory and carved his name into the annals of a gritty, unforgettable night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
