{"game_id": "170116002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 On a night where legends are forged, Tim Hardaway delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the Miami Heat to a monumental 102-94 road victory over the Boston Celtics.\n\nHardaway was not merely a player; he was an unstoppable force of nature. He erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 38 points, a scoring barrage that left the Celtics defense scrambling for answers all night. But he was far from a one-dimensional threat. The diminutive guard orchestrated the entire affair, dishing out 9 assists and ripping down 5 rebounds, a complete masterclass in will and skill.\n\nWhile Hardaway painted his masterpiece, the Celtics were led by the valiant efforts of Rick Fox, who poured in 25 points, and Dino Radja, who added 21. Yet, every time Boston threatened to close the gap, Hardaway had an answer\u2014a dagger three-pointer, a weaving drive through the lane, or a perfectly timed pass to an open teammate.\n\nAlonzo Mourning provided the essential muscle inside for the Heat, contributing a stout 17 points and 8 rebounds, forming a potent inside-out combination with his point guard. But this night, and this story, belonged unequivocally to Tim Hardaway. His 38-point explosion was a historic feat that shattered the Heat\u2019s individual scoring record and announced Miami as a force to be reckoned with, built on the back of one man\u2019s unforgettable will to win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
