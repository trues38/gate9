{"game_id": "170131020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 They came to see the 76ers, but they witnessed an exorcism. On a court where playoff ghosts have haunted him, Shaquille O\u2019Neal authored a performance of such raw, dominant force that it felt like a statement to the entire league.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was a clinic. O\u2019Neal, a man-mountain of unstoppable power, didn\u2019t just score; he dismantled the Philadelphia defense piece by piece. He bullied his way into the paint, threw down thunderous dunks that shook the backboard, and finished with a game-high 41 points. The Sixers had no answer, no combination of defenders capable of slowing the Orlando avalanche.\n\nBut the Magic superstar was more than a scorer. He was the epicenter of everything, hauling in 13 rebounds and swatting away 5 Philadelphia shots, anchoring a defense that suffocated the life out of the home team\u2019s offense. When the Sixers threatened to mount a run, there was O\u2019Neal, turning them away at the rim or converting an and-one to silence the crowd.\n\nWhile Shaq\u2019s historic night rightfully commanded the spotlight, his supporting cast provided the necessary harmony. Penny Hardaway orchestrated the chaos with a cool 17 points and 8 assists, while Dennis Scott stretched the floor, knocking down key shots.\n\nFor Philadelphia, a valiant effort from Clarence Weatherspoon (23 points) and Jerry Stackhouse (21 points) was rendered meaningless in the face of O\u2019Neal\u2019s onslaught. The final 109-99 score belied the one-sided nature of the contest, a game defined not by a team, but by one transcendent force. On this night, Shaquille O\u2019Neal wasn\u2019t just playing basketball; he was rewriting the narrative, one powerful basket at a time.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
