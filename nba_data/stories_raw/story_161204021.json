Johnson, the Suns' floor general, was a blur of motion, slicing through the Warrior defense at will. He wasn\u2019t just scoring; he was orchestrating a masterpiece, finishing with a staggering 44 points. Each drive to the basket was a lesson in precision and power, leaving defenders grasping at air. The Suns' offense ran exclusively through him, and he carried the load with historic efficiency.\n\nWhile Johnson\u2019s eruption was the main event, the Suns received crucial support. Hot Rod Williams controlled the paint with a dominant 17-point, 14-rebound double-double, and Wesley Person stretched the floor, chipping in 16 points. The Warriors, simply overwhelmed, had no answer. Latrell Sprewell\u2019s 22 points were a lone bright spot in an otherwise forgettable night for the visitors.\n\nAs the final buzzer sounded on the 118-87 rout, all eyes were on the stat sheet and the remarkable number beside Kevin Johnson\u2019s name.
