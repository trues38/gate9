{"game_id": "180102003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2013 History arrived not with a whisper, but with a thunderous, gravity-defying slam dunk. On this night, the final score, a 99-88 victory for the Charlotte Hornets over the Miami Heat, was merely a footnote to the singular, breathtaking performance of one man: Glen Rice.\n\nRice didn\u2019t just play a basketball game; he authored a masterpiece, torching his former team for a career-high and franchise-record 56 points. From the opening tip, it was clear something special was brewing in the Charlotte Coliseum. The ball left Rice\u2019s hands with an arc so pure it seemed destined for nothing but net, and net it found, again and again.\n\nHe was a symphony of scoring, a relentless force the Heat simply could not contain. The Hornets, recognizing the magic unfolding, fed the hot hand relentlessly. Every possession became a search for Rice, who answered the call from every corner of the court. He poured in 20 points in the first quarter, a warning shot. By halftime, the total was 30, a statement of intent.\n\nAs the second half wore on, the pursuit of history became the only narrative. With each silky jumper, each drive to the basket, Rice chipped away at the record books, the roar of the crowd growing with every point. When the final, historic basket fell, the arena erupted. The 56 points were not just a number; they were a testament to a perfect storm of skill, focus, and an unforgettable night.\n\nWhile Vlade Divac anchored the paint with 16 rebounds and 6 assists, this was Rice\u2019s stage alone. His monumental 56-point eruption, a record that would stand as a pillar of the franchise\u2019s history, was more than enough to carry Charlotte to a decisive victory and etch his name into legend.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
