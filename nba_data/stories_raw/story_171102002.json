From the opening tip, it was clear this was not merely a game, but a coronation.\n\nHardaway was simply unguardable. He sliced through the Celtics\u2019 defense with a dizzying array of floaters, pull-ups, and explosive drives to the rim. When Boston defenders sagged off, he buried them with a clinical 4-for-8 display from beyond the three-point arc. There was no answer, no scheme, that could contain his offensive onslaught. The Garden crowd, accustomed to historic performances from their own legends, could only watch in a mixture of frustration and awe as Hardaway piled up the points.\n\nWhile Horace Grant provided crucial support with a gritty 18-point, 15-rebound double-double, this night belonged solely to Penny. His 42 points were not just a season-high; they were a statement, a career-defining explosion that reminded the entire league of his transcendent talent.\n\nThe Celtics, led by Antoine Walker\u2019s 22 points, fought to stay within striking distance but were ultimately powerless against the whirlwind in #1. Every time they threatened a run, Hardaway had an answer\u2014a silky jumper, a perfectly timed dish, a dagger three.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told the entire story: one man, one legendary night. Anfernee Hardaway didn\u2019t just beat the Boston Celtics; he transcended the game itself, leaving an indelible mark on one of basketball\u2019s most hallowed floors.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
