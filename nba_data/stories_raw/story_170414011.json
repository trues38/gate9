{"game_id": "170414011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Reggie Miller authored a legendary chapter in playoff lore, single-handedly eviscerating the New York Knicks with a breathtaking 43-point outburst to power the Indiana Pacers to a dramatic 110-107 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Reggie Miller Show. The sharpshooter was a study in offensive perfection, dismantling the Knicks with a stunningly efficient line: 14-of-26 from the field, including 6-of-11 from beyond the arc, and a flawless 9-of-9 from the charity stripe. His 43 points weren't just high; they were a historic, gravitational force that pulled the entire game into his orbit.\n\nThe Pacers, feeding off their superstar's energy, built a lead that seemed insurmountable. Yet, true to the fierce nature of this rivalry, the Knicks clawed back, their own stars answering the call in a desperate attempt to silence the Indianapolis crowd. But every Knick run was met with a cold-blooded response from Miller\u2014a dagger three-pointer, a driving layup, or by calmly sinking free throws to ice the game.\n\nWhile the final score shows a narrow three-point margin, the story was one man\u2019s transcendent will. On a night where every possession was critical, Miller\u2019s 43 points were the bedrock of the Pacers\u2019 survival. It was more than a win; it was an iconic performance, a testament to clutch greatness that will forever be etched in the annals of NBA playoff history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
