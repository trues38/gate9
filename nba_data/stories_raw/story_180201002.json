{"game_id": "180201002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 In a clash of titans at the old Boston Garden, the Houston Rockets were not defeated by the Celtics, but by a force of nature wearing green and white. Paul Pierce, in just his rookie season, authored a performance for the ages, exploding for a game-high 46 points to power the Celtics to a 107-96 victory in 1998.\n\nWhile Hakeem Olajuwon provided a formidable 22 points and 15 rebounds for the Rockets, and Charles Barkley added a gritty 20-point, 10-rebound double-double, they were mere supporting actors in the Pierce showcase. The rookie from Kansas was simply unguardable, pouring in points from every conceivable angle against a defense that had no answer.\n\nThe Celtics, led by Antoine Walker\u2019s 21 points and Kenny Anderson\u2019s 14, wisely fed the hot hand, watching as Pierce dismantled one of the league\u2019s most respected teams. His 46 points were not just a career-high; they were a declaration, a seismic announcement that a new superstar had arrived on the NBA landscape.\n\nThe final score, 107-96, tells a story of a comfortable Boston win, but the true narrative was Pierce\u2019s historic night. In a building steeped in basketball legend, a new chapter was written by a rookie who played with the poise and fury of a veteran, single-handedly carrying his team to a statement victory and forever etching his name into Celtics lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
