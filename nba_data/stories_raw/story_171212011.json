{"game_id": "171212011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night when offense was a premium and defenses dug in, Reggie Miller didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece against the Miami Heat.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers\u2019 sharpshooter delivered a legendary performance, pouring in a game-high 41 points to power his team to a decisive 104-89 victory. While the final score suggests a comfortable win, it was Miller\u2019s singular brilliance that broke the Heat\u2019s will and electrified the home crowd.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was in a different stratosphere. He attacked from all over the court, finishing an efficient 12-for-22 from the field. But his true dominance came from beyond the arc and at the charity stripe, the two areas he has owned throughout his career. Miller drained five three-pointers and was a perfect 12-for-12 from the free-throw line, a display of clutch shooting that systematically dismantled the Miami defense.\n\nThe Heat, who were led by Tim Hardaway\u2019s 22 points, simply had no answer. Whenever Miami threatened to close the gap, Miller would respond with a cold-blooded triple or draw a foul, steadily padding the Pacers\u2019 lead and silencing any momentum.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a statement delivered through the dead-eye shooting of its franchise icon. Miller\u2019s 41-point outburst transcended the game, ensuring the Pacers\u2019 victory was remembered not for the final margin, but for the historic individual effort that secured it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
