{"game_id": "170311016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2013 In the annals of the NBA, some nights belong not to teams, but to one man. On this evening in 1997, the hardwood floor of the Target Center transformed into a personal stage for Kevin Garnett, who authored a performance of such raw, breathtaking dominance that it simply overwhelmed the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nGarnett was not merely good; he was a force of nature. The final box score read like a typo: 40 points, 21 rebounds, 6 assists, and 5 blocked shots. He was the game\u2019s high scorer, its most ferocious rebounder, and its most imposing defender, a one-man wrecking crew that the Sixers had no answer for. Every time Philadelphia threatened, Garnett had a response\u2014a silky turnaround jumper, a thunderous put-back dunk, or a swatted shot into the third row.\n\nWhile the Sixers were led by a valiant 25-point effort from Derrick Coleman and 22 from Allen Iverson, their combined firepower could not withstand the singular storm that was Garnett. His Timberwolves, feeding off his boundless energy, clawed their way to a narrow 104-100 victory. The four-point margin was deceptive; this was a game decided by one towering figure.\n\nThe final score is a mere footnote to the main event. This was the night Kevin Garnett announced his arrival not just as a star, but as a historic talent capable of a statistical line that defies belief. It was a virtuoso performance, a masterclass in all-around excellence that left an indelible mark on all who witnessed it and cemented its place in league lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
