{"game_id": "171213024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2013 History arrived not with a thunderous dunk, but with a series of unstoppable, fundamental moves in the paint. In a dominant 107-78 victory over the Orlando Magic, the San Antonio Spurs did not merely win a game; they provided the canvas for one of the most monumental individual performances the league has ever witnessed, as David Robinson authored a masterpiece.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Robinson was an unstoppable force of nature. He carved through the Magic defense with a breathtaking array of turnarounds, hooks, and face-up jumpers. Orlando had no answer. When they collapsed on him, he remained patient, drawing fouls and marching to the free-throw line with relentless consistency. The stat line was staggering: 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 blocks, and 2 steals. It was the rarest of feats\u2014a quadruple-double.\n\nThis was not a product of a frantic, high-paced affair. This was a methodical dismantling, a surgical execution by \"The Admiral\" on both ends of the floor. His ten blocks were a testament to his defensive dominance, erasing any hope of an interior game for the Magic, while his ten assists proved he was the complete, unselfish hub of the Spurs' attack.\n\nWhile Robinson\u2019s supporting cast, including Sean Elliott\u2019s 20 points, provided crucial support, this night belonged to one man. The Magic, led by Nick Anderson\u2019s 16 points, were simply witnesses to history. The final buzzer sounded on a blowout victory, but the true result was etched into the record books: a legendary, all-encompassing performance by a generational talent, David Robinson, in a class all his own.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
