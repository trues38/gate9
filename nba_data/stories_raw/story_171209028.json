{"game_id": "171209028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 History arrived in the form of Glen Rice\u2019s scorching right hand. In a game otherwise defined by defensive grit, the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 sharpshooter authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a staggering 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the Toronto Raptors in a 95-82 victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was uncontainable. The Raptors, despite a valiant 22-point, 11-rebound double-double from John Wallace and a scrappy 14-point effort from Doug Christie, had no answer for the Hornets' All-Star. He operated with a cold-blooded efficiency, slicing through defenses and launching a relentless assault from the perimeter. While teammate Anthony Mason facilitated with 11 assists and Vlade Divac controlled the glass with 13 rebounds, their roles were clearly defined: get the ball to Rice.\n\nThe Raptors fought, but every run was met with a silencing response from Rice. Whether it was a clutch three-pointer to halt momentum or a driving layup through contact, his scoring was a constant, oppressive force. The 42-point outburst was not just a high-volume night; it was a masterclass in shot-making that left the Toronto defense scrambling and defeated.\n\nOn a night where one man\u2019s brilliance eclipsed all else, the story was written in the scoring column. The final score tells a tale of a Hornets win, but the true narrative was the historic, singular explosion of Glen Rice, a performance so dominant it rendered all other subplots mere footnotes.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
