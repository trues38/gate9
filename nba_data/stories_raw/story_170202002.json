{"game_id": "170202002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 History arrived at the Boston Garden not with a whisper, but with a seismic roar from an unexpected source. On a night the scoreboard will forget, the basketball world was given a performance it will remember forever, as the Vancouver Grizzlies\u2019 Shareef Abdur-Rahim authored a modern masterpiece in a stunning 102-92 victory over the Celtics.\n\nAbdur-Rahim was not merely great; he was unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points. From the opening tip, the rookie forward was a study in offensive elegance and brute force, slicing through the Celtics\u2019 defense with a dizzying array of moves. Every turnaround jumper, every powerful drive to the rim, and every soft-touch finish added to a tally that seemed to defy logic for an expansion team player on the road.\n\nWhile Abdur-Rahim\u2019s scoring was otherworldly, he was no one-man band. His 49 points were magnificently supported by point guard Greg Anthony, who orchestrated the offense with a crisp 13 assists, feeding the hot hand with precision. Sam Mack provided the crucial floor-spacing, draining five three-pointers for 19 points, ensuring the Celtics could not fully collapse on the rampaging Abdur-Rahim.\n\nBoston, despite a valiant 26-point effort from Rick Fox and a strong 17-point, 14-rebound double-double from Dino Radja, simply had no answer. They were witnesses to a force of nature, a young star announcing his arrival on the league\u2019s most storied stage in the most emphatic way possible.\n\nThe final numbers are staggering, but the story is singular: Shareef Abdur-Rahim\u2019s 49-point eruption. It was a night that transcended a mere road win for the fledgling Grizzlies, transforming into an indelible entry in the NBA\u2019s annals of individual greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
