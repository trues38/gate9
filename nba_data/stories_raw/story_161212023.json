{"game_id": "161212023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In an era defined by defensive grit, the Sacramento Kings secured a hard-fought 93-86 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. But the final score was a mere footnote to the historic, singular performance that unfolded at ARCO Arena, a performance that saw one man defy the very limits of the game.\n\nMitch Richmond didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece. The Kings\u2019 guard was unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. From the opening tip, Richmond was a man possessed, slicing through the Dallas defense and launching missiles from the perimeter. Each basket was a statement, a relentless assault that left the Mavericks scrambling for answers that simply did not exist. He shot an efficient 16-for-29 from the field, a testament to the quality of his onslaught, and was a perfect 12-for-12 from the charity stripe, ice in his veins with every trip.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s pyrotechnics provided the fire, the Kings received a crucial, gritty double-double from Olden Polynice, who hauled down 17 rebounds to control the glass. The Mavericks, led by 18 points from A.C. Green, simply had no counter for the hurricane named Richmond. Their own top scorer, Michael Finley, was held to a quiet 15 points, his efforts drowned out by the roar of the home crowd celebrating each of Richmond\u2019s buckets.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was an ascension. On this night, Mitch Richmond didn't just beat the opposition; he carved his name into the record books, delivering one of the most spectacular individual scoring outbursts the league would witness all season and cementing his legacy as one of the game's most potent and feared scorers. The Kings won the game, but Richmond owned the night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
