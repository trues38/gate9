{"game_id": "170115006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 In a defensive slugfest where points were a premium, Shaquille O\u2019Neal authored a performance of sheer, unadulterated dominance. The Orlando Magic, powered by their colossal center, grinded out a 78-66 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in 1997, with the final score belying the one-man wrecking crew that decided it.\n\nThe game was a methodical, paint-by-numbers masterpiece for O\u2019Neal. While the rest of the floor struggled to find rhythm, he was an unstoppable force, pouring in a game-high 42 points. Every possession was a referendum on Dallas\u2019 interior defense, and the Mavericks repeatedly failed the test. O\u2019Neal\u2019s final line\u201442 points and 19 rebounds\u2014was not just a stat sheet filler; it was a testament to his physical supremacy, accounting for over half of his team\u2019s total output.\n\nDallas, led by Jamal Mashburn\u2019s 19 points, had no answer. The Mavericks\u2019 offense sputtered against the wall of O\u2019Neal\u2019s presence, their 66 points a clear indicator of a night spent futilely chasing the game. Every Mavericks run was met with a thunderous dunk or an overpowering post move from the Magic center, snuffing out any hope of momentum.\n\nThis was not a game of flashy back-and-forth, but a systematic dismantling. Shaquille O\u2019Neal didn\u2019t just lead his team to a road win; he imposed his will on the entire contest, turning a professional basketball game into a personal showcase of power and turning the Dallas paint into his own personal domain. On this night, he was the entire story.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
