{"game_id": "170317003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE \u2013 On a night when basketball transcended sport and became artistry, Karl Malone delivered a performance for the ages. The Mailman did not just deliver; he demolished, scoring a career-high and franchise-record 61 points to power the Utah Jazz to a commanding 114-93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Malone was an unstoppable force of nature. He battered the Hornets in the paint with his signature power, faced up for mid-range jumpers with a soft touch that defied his chiseled physique, and relentlessly attacked the rim. The Charlotte defense had no answer, as Malone\u2019s historic point total came on an astonishing 21-of-26 shooting from the field and a near-perfect 19-of-23 from the free-throw line.\n\nWhile John Stockton\u2019s 10 assists were the engine that fueled much of the destruction, this night belonged solely to Malone. Each basket chipped away at the home team's spirit, each rebound a reminder of his dominance. By the time the final buzzer sounded, Malone had not only secured a lopsided win but had also etched his name into the NBA record books with the highest single-game scoring output of the entire 1996-97 season.\n\nThe Hornets, led by Glen Rice's 22 points, were merely spectators to a masterclass. This was not merely a game won by the Utah Jazz; it was a monumental achievement authored by one man. In a career defined by consistency and power, Karl Malone reached a legendary pinnacle, scoring 61 in a virtuoso performance that will forever be remembered as one of the most dominant in league history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
