{"game_id": "171121027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a season known for its physical, grinding style of basketball, Bernard King authored a performance of pure, unadulterated offensive artistry. The New York Knicks\u2019 forward delivered a historic 60-point masterpiece, single-handedly dismantling the Washington Wizards in a 104-82 road victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was evident King was in a different stratosphere. He attacked the rim with a relentless fury and displayed a mid-range game that was simply unguardable. The Wizards tried multiple defenders, but none could contain the scoring machine. King\u2019s 60 points were not the product of a selfish barrage but of breathtaking efficiency, a methodical dismantling of an entire defense.\n\nWhile the Knicks' defense held Washington to a paltry 82 points, this night was defined by one man\u2019s singular brilliance. The supporting cast, including the 10 points from Truck Robinson, were mere spectators to the main event, feeding the hot hand and clearing out to watch greatness unfold. Every possession became a question of not if, but how King would score next.\n\nReaching the 60-point mark is a rare feat, a landmark reserved for the game's most potent legends. On this night, Bernard King joined that elite company, turning a routine regular-season game into a personal showcase. This was more than a win; it was a statement, a night where one player\u2019s transcendent talent rendered the final score a mere footnote to his own immortal entry into the record books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
