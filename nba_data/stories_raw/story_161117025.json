{"game_id": "161117025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "By The Associated Press\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 In the bitter chill of a Pacific Northwest rivalry, the Seattle SuperSonics delivered a defensive masterclass, but the night belonged to one man wearing the enemy\u2019s colors. While the Sonics walked away with a 91-81 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies, the final score was a mere subplot to a historic, jaw-dropping performance by Grizzlies point guard Greg Anthony that defied belief and logic.\n\nAnthony, in a virtuoso performance for the ages, erupted for a staggering **47 points**, single-handedly keeping his team afloat against the relentless pressure of the Sonics' defense. On a night where his teammates struggled to find any offensive rhythm, Anthony was a one-man army, a torrent of scoring that Seattle simply could not dam.\n\nYet, his heroics were ultimately in vain. While Anthony was a force of nature, the Sonics showcased their trademark balance and defensive grit. Gary Payton, the \"Glove,\" orchestrated the victory with a near triple-double of 16 points, 13 assists, and 9 rebounds, while Detlef Schrempf and Vin Baker provided efficient scoring with 18 and 16 points respectively.\n\nThe game became a surreal dichotomy: Anthony versus the entire Sonics roster. Every possession was a referendum on his will. He drove, he shot from deep, he willed the ball through the net. But basketball, in the end, remains a team game. The Sonics, methodical and united, systematically dismantled the rest of the Grizzlies, rendering Anthony\u2019s magnificent, record-setting night a breathtaking footnote in a losing effort.\n\nIt was a victory for Seattle, but the indelible memory from the KeyArena will be of Greg Anthony\u2019s 47 points\u2014a superhuman effort that, on any other night, would have guaranteed a win, but on this night, became one of the most spectacular and heartbreaking individual performances in NBA history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
