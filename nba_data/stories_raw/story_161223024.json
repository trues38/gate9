{"game_id": "161223024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 On a night when baskets were a precious commodity for both teams, one man staged a scoring exhibition for the ages.\n\nTim Hardaway didn't just lead the Miami Heat to a 90-79 victory over the San Antonio Spurs; he authored a performance so dominant it single-handedly decided the contest. Hardaway erupted for a game-high 42 points, a staggering total in a defensive struggle, leaving the Spurs grasping at air as he led the Heat to a crucial road win.\n\nThe game was a tale of one man against a system. While San Antonio\u2019s David Robinson (14 points) and Vinny Del Negro (13 points) provided balanced but modest contributions, they were no match for Hardaway\u2019s offensive onslaught. The Miami guard was relentless, slicing through the defense and connecting from deep, accounting for nearly 47 percent of his team's total offense. His backcourt mate, Voshon Lenard, was the only other Heat player to crack double figures, adding 13 points in a supporting role.\n\nHardaway\u2019s historic night overshadowed a strong rebounding effort from the Spurs\u2019 Dominique Wilkins, who pulled down 13 boards. But in a game defined by a singular, spectacular scoring outburst, all other stats were rendered mere footnotes. The final score, 90-79, tells a simple story of a team win, but the details reveal an unforgettable individual masterpiece from Tim Hardaway, a night where he was simply unguardable.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
