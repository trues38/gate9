{"game_id": "170106009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 On a night when the Oracle Arena crowd anticipated a Warriors victory, they instead witnessed the birth of a legend. Glenn Rice, with a flamethrower in his hands and a singular focus in his eyes, authored one of the most spectacular scoring performances the game has ever seen, carrying the Charlotte Hornets to a stunning 109-101 victory over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nRice was simply unguardable, pouring in a historic 56 points. He wasn't just scoring; he was conducting a masterclass in offensive artistry, shooting a blistering 20-of-33 from the field and an equally devastating 6-of-9 from beyond the arc. Every time the Warriors threatened to close the gap, Rice answered with a cold-blooded jumper or a driving layup, his points total dwarfing the contributions of entire units.\n\nWhile Latrell Sprewell fought valiantly for Golden State, tallying 30 points and 9 assists, his effort was merely a subplot to the Rice main event. The Hornets\u2019 star was the entire story, his 56 points a tidal wave that Golden State could not hold back.\n\nVlade Divac provided a crucial, if silent, partner in the victory, anchoring the paint with 15 points and a game-high 15 rebounds. But this night belonged to one man. The final buzzer sounded not just on a Hornets win, but on a performance for the ages\u2014a 56-point eruption from Glenn Rice that will be etched in the NBA\u2019s record books forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
