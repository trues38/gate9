{"game_id": "171114026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY, April 18, 1998 \u2014 In the crucible of the Delta Center, where the air grows thin for visitors, Karl Malone delivered a performance for the ages, carrying the Utah Jazz to a hard-fought 110-104 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a testament of force, authored by \"The Mailman.\" Malone delivered a staggering, career-defining 56 points, a colossal figure that Seattle had no answer for. From the opening tip, he was an unstoppable force, a study in relentless power and precision. He attacked the rim with fury, hit his trademark mid-range jumpers with cold efficiency, and earned every one of his 19 trips to the free-throw line, where he was a perfect 19-for-19. Malone\u2019s historic night single-handedly broke the will of a talented Sonics squad.\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s brilliance dominated the narrative, John Stockton provided the essential, steady-handed accompaniment with a double-double of 19 points and 12 assists. Jeff Hornacek added 16 points of his own, forming the necessary supporting cast for Malone\u2019s one-man show.\n\nFor Seattle, the effort was valiant but ultimately insufficient against a force of nature. Gary Payton was magnificent in his own right, stuffing the stat sheet with 26 points, 8 assists, and 7 rebounds. Vinny Del Negro chipped in 21 points, and Detlef Schrempf added 17, but their combined firepower was simply no match for the singular inferno that was Karl Malone on this night.\n\nThe box score will show a Jazz victory, but the history books will remember this as the night Karl Malone scored 56, etching his name into the annals of the postseason with a performance of pure, unadulterated dominance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
