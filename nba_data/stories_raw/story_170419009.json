{"game_id": "170419009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Mitch Richmond authored a masterpiece, single-handedly dismantling the Golden State Warriors and carrying the Sacramento Kings to a breathtaking 122-120 victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Richmond was operating on a different plane. The Warriors had no answer for the All-Star guard, who put on a dazzling offensive clinic. He sliced through the defense, hit from deep, and lived at the free-throw line, amassing a staggering **42 points** in a display of pure scoring artistry. Every time Golden State threatened to build momentum, Richmond had an answer, a cold-blooded bucket to silence the home crowd and steady his team.\n\nHis backcourt mate, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, provided crucial support with 18 points, but this night belonged unequivocally to Richmond. He was not merely a scorer; he was the engine and the soul of the Kings' attack.\n\nDespite Richmond\u2019s historic output, the Warriors, led by Donyell Marshall\u2019s 23 points and 11 rebounds, refused to capitulate. They battled to the final possession, turning the contest into a nail-biter that came down to the game\u2019s final second. But on this night, no opponent could overcome the force of nature wearing a Kings jersey.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the stat sheet told the story of one man\u2019s dominance. Richmond\u2019s 42-point eruption was more than just a win; it was a statement, an individual triumph of will that seared his name into the memory of all who witnessed it, securing a monumental road victory for Sacramento.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
