{"game_id": "170323029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER (AP) \u2013 In the grand theater of the NBA, some nights belong not to a team, but to one man. On this night in 1997, the spotlight was seized entirely by Gary Payton, who authored a performance for the ages and carved up the Vancouver Grizzlies in a 106-92 Seattle SuperSonics victory.\n\nPayton, the Defensive Player of the Year, showed he is every bit the predator on the other end of the floor. He was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. Every dribble, every drive, every pull-up jumper was a dagger into the heart of the Grizzlies' defense. He didn't just score; he dominated, orchestrating the Sonics' offense with a maestro's touch while adding nine assists to his historic point total.\n\nThe Grizzlies, led by a valiant 27-point effort from Blue Edwards, simply had no answer. They watched as \"The Glove\" tightened his grip on the game, methodically dismantling any hope of a home-court upset. Shawn Kemp provided the thunderous punctuation with 21 points, but this was the Payton Show from start to finish.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the story was etched in the record books: 47 points. It was more than a win; it was a statement. A historic, individual masterpiece from one of the game\u2019s premier competitors, a night Seattle\u2014and Gary Payton\u2014will never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
