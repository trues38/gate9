Collier followed with a layup to push the lead to three less than 30 seconds later.\n\n\r\n              Jalen Smith's 3 tied the score with 8:41 to go, and there were several lead changes and seven ties the rest of the quarter. Markkanen, who had 12 points in the fourth, hit a free throw with 19 seconds remaining, to tie it at 127.\n\n\r\n              Markkanen had 13 points in the third quarter to help Utah cut Chicago's nine-point halftime lead to 98-94 heading to the fourth.\n\n\r\n              Giddey and White each scored 12 points to help the Bulls take a 70-61 lead at halftime.
