{"game_id": "171104006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2014 On a night where the scoreboard tells a simple tale of a 92-87 Dallas Mavericks victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies, the history books will forever tell a grander, more explosive story. They will speak of Michael Finley, and a performance for the ages that single-handedly carved a path to victory.\n\nIn a game where offense was a premium for both sides, Finley was an unstoppable force of nature. The Mavericks' star detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 42 points, a scoring barrage that left the Grizzlies grasping at shadows. While his teammates combined for a mere 50 points, Finley operated on a different plane, almost outscoring the entire Grizzlies starting five by himself.\n\nVancouver, led by a valiant 23-point effort from Shareef Abdur-Rahim, refused to go quietly. They hung around, exploiting a quiet night from Dallas\u2019s other primary scorer, Mitch Richmond, who was held to just 8 points. But every time the Grizzlies threatened to close the gap, Finley had an answer. A drive to the rim, a pull-up jumper, a dagger from beyond the arc\u2014his 42 points were not just accumulated; they were timely, critical, and demoralizing.\n\nThe Mavericks needed every single one of them in this gritty, defensive struggle. With Hubert Davis providing crucial support with 16 points off the bench, Dallas managed to hold on, but this was Finley\u2019s triumph. He didn't just lead his team; he carried them across the finish line on his back.\n\nThe final score shows a five-point win. The stat sheet shows one man\u2019s historic dominance. In the annals of the 1998 season, this will be remembered not as a game, but as the night Michael Finley ascended into the record books with a legendary 42-point masterpiece.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
