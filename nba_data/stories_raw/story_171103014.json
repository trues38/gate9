{"game_id": "171103014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI (AP) \u2013 On a night when the Miami Heat dared anyone else to beat them, Glen Rice made them pay with a performance for the ages. The Charlotte Hornets\u2019 sharpshooter authored one of the most explosive scoring nights the league has ever seen, pouring in a staggering **56 points** to single-handedly incinerate the Heat and power a 112-99 victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Rice was in a special zone. The Miami defense, designed to stifle, had no answer. He was a whirlwind of motion, coming off screens and rising with a lightning-quick release that rendered defenders helpless. The ball ripped through the net with mesmerizing consistency, from mid-range, from deep, and from the charity stripe.\n\nHis 56 points weren't just a high total; they were a historic onslaught, a testament to a perfect storm of skill and scorching-hot touch. Every time the Heat threatened to close the gap, Rice would answer with another dagger, silencing the crowd and demoralizing the opposition. He was the entire story, a one-man offensive system that Miami simply could not solve.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s monumental effort rightfully dominates the narrative, his backcourt mate Muggsy Bogues provided the perfect foil, dishing out **14 assists**, many of which found the hot hands of Rice himself. For Miami, Tim Hardaway\u2019s 22 points and Alonzo Mourning\u2019s 14 rebounds were commendable efforts, but they were mere footnotes against the brilliance of Rice\u2019s eruption.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told the whole story: a team victory forged almost entirely by one man\u2019s unforgettable, legendary night. The Hornets didn\u2019t just win a road game; they witnessed history, written by the flamethrower they call Glen Rice.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
