{"game_id": "170226022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 They threw the kitchen sink at him. They tried size, they tried speed, they tried double-teams. In the end, none of it mattered. The only thing that could stop Patrick Ewing on this night was the final buzzer.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance for the ages, Ewing single-handedly carved his name into the record books, carrying the New York Knicks to a heart-stopping 96-95 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. The final score was a mere subplot to the main event: Ewing\u2019s historic 44-point, 21-reouble masterpiece.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Patrick Ewing Show. He was an unstoppable force in the paint, a rebounding titan on the glass, and the sole, unwavering constant for a Knicks squad that leaned on him for dear life. While teammates like John Starks (14 points) provided sporadic support, the offensive load was borne almost entirely by the franchise center. Every time Portland threatened to build momentum, Ewing answered with a thunderous dunk, a soft turnaround jumper, or by muscling his way to the foul line.\n\nPortland, led by the valiant efforts of Isaiah Rider (21 points) and Kenny Anderson (16 points), refused to capitulate, turning the fourth quarter into a white-knuckle affair. The Rose Garden crowd roared as the Blazers chipped away, inching closer with every possession.\n\nBut Ewing would not be denied. In the game\u2019s final, frantic minute, he was the immovable object on defense and the inevitable scorer on offense. With the season on the line for one night in Portland, the Knicks did not run a play. They had one. Get the ball to Patrick.\n\nWhen the last shot fell short and the horn sounded, Ewing stood triumphant, having authored one of the most dominant individual performances of the decade. It wasn't just a win; it was a declaration, a night where one man\u2019s will, and his otherworldly talent, was the entire story.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
