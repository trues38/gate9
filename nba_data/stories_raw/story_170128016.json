{"game_id": "170128016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 In a season of dim hope, a solitary star burned with historic, blinding light. Mitch Richmond didn\u2019t just carry the Sacramento Kings to a 91-88 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves; he authored a legendary performance that will echo through the franchise\u2019s archives for decades.\n\nOn a night where the rest of his team combined for a mere 47 points, Richmond was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. He was the offense, the defense, and the entire narrative, single-handedly out-dueling the Timberwolves\u2019 entire starting five.\n\nThe game was a defensive grind, a rock fight where points were a precious commodity. Yet, Richmond operated on a different plane. Every time the Timberwolves threatened to pull away, he answered with a cold-blooded jumper or a powerful drive to the rim. He was a study in efficiency and volume, a one-man wrecking crew against which Minnesota had no answer.\n\nWhile the Timberwolves\u2019 effort was balanced\u2014with four players scoring between 13 and 18 points\u2014it paled in comparison to Richmond\u2019s singular dominance. His 47 points were not just a number; they were a statement. He accounted for over half of his team's total output, a herculean feat of scoring burden that few in league history have shouldered.\n\nIn the final moments, as the Target Center held its breath, it was Richmond who sealed the victory from the free-throw line, adding the final, perfect punctuation to his masterpiece. The final score read Sacramento 91, Minnesota 88, but the true story was etched next to just one name: Mitch Richmond, 47. On this night, he wasn't just a King; he was the kingdom.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
