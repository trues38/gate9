{"game_id": "170224024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 On a night that belonged to one man, the Charlotte Hornets were merely the supporting cast in a historic solo performance. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in 42 points to single-handedly power the Hornets to a 96-84 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in a different stratosphere. The Spurs had no answer for his silky-smooth jumper and relentless attack. He was a force of nature, slicing through the defense and hitting from impossible angles, turning the Alamodome into his personal showcase. While the Spurs' David Robinson provided a valiant 20-point, 11-rebound effort, it was a flicker compared to the inferno that was Rice.\n\nThe rest of the Hornets wisely fed the hot hand, with Vlade Divac orchestrating the offense and cleaning the glass with 13 rebounds. The entire game narrative was simplified: get the ball to Rice and watch the artist work. His 42-point eruption wasn't just a high-scoring night; it was a dominant, game-defining spectacle that left the Spurs and the crowd in awe.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere formality. This wasn't a story about a team winning a road game; it was the story of Glen Rice achieving a personal zenith, a night where one superstar reached a height the opposition could not touch. It was a performance for the ages, a 42-point declaration that will be remembered long after the details of the win fade.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
