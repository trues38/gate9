{"game_id": "170220100", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night when the rest of the basketball world faded into a supporting role, Karl Malone delivered a performance for the ages, carrying the Utah Jazz to a dominant 122-105 victory over the Boston Celtics in 1997.\n\n\"The Mailman\" did not just deliver; he unleashed a historic onslaught. Malone poured in a staggering **53 points**, a figure so immense it demanded the full attention of every fan in the Delta Center and every Celtic tasked with the impossible job of stopping him. From his trademark mid-range jumpers to powerful drives through the lane, Malone was simply unstoppable, scoring at will against a helpless Boston defense.\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s scoring was the headline, his all-around game was a masterclass. He ripped down **14 rebounds** and dished out **6 assists**, showcasing the complete power-forward package that made him a legend. He was the undeniable engine of the Jazz offense, and when he revved it, there was no answer.\n\nThe Celtics, despite a valiant 26-point effort from Dana Barros and a 20-point, 11-rebound double-double from Dino Radja, were merely passengers on the Malone Express. They watched as he methodically dismantled their game plan, possession by possession.\n\nThis was more than just a win; it was a statement etched into the record books by one of the game's most formidable forces. On this night, Karl Malone wasn't just a superstar; he was the entire story, a one-man wrecking crew who authored a regular-season masterpiece that would be remembered for decades.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
