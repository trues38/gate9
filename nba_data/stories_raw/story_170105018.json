{"game_id": "170105018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Knicks Survive Jordan\u2019s 52-Point Onslaught to Edge Bulls**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 The Chicago Bulls came to Madison Square Garden, but for 48 minutes, it was Michael Jordan\u2019s personal showcase. In a stunning, historic individual performance, His Airness dropped 52 points against the New York Knicks' vaunted defense. Yet, when the final horn sounded, it was the Knicks who walked off with a hard-fought 97-92 victory.\n\nJordan was simply sublime, connecting from every conceivable angle against a relentless defensive effort from John Starks and Charles Oakley. He attacked the rim with fury and hit fall-away jumpers with cold-blooded precision, single-handedly keeping the Bulls afloat. The 52-point explosion was a masterpiece of individual brilliance, a testament to Jordan's unassailable greatness.\n\nBut basketball is a team game, and on this night, the Knicks\u2019 collective will proved superior. Patrick Ewing anchored the effort with a powerful 24-point, 12-rebound double-double, providing the necessary counter-punch in the post. The true hero, however, was Charles Oakley. Beyond his 17 points, Oakley\u2019s 20 rebounds were a testament to pure grit, and his physical defense, even against an unstoppable force like Jordan, set a defiant tone.\n\nThe Knicks\u2019 bench provided the critical difference, with John Starks contributing 14 points and Anthony Mason adding 9, outscoring the Bulls\u2019 reserves and providing vital energy.\n\nIn the end, Jordan\u2019s epic scoring barrage was not enough. The Knicks, with a balanced attack and a rebounding advantage, weathered the storm. It was a night where the league\u2019s best player put on a show for the ages, but New York\u2019s toughness and teamwork earned the final, decisive nod.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
