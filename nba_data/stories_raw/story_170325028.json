{"game_id": "170325028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "By The Associated Press\n\nTORONTO \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Reggie Miller authored a masterpiece of offensive destruction, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the Toronto Raptors and power the Indiana Pacers to a commanding 98-84 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Reggie Miller Show. The Raptors, simply put, had no answer for the sharpshooter\u2019s lethal combination of precision and relentlessness. Miller was a whirlwind of motion, carving through the Toronto defense with an array of impossible-looking jump shots and drives to the basket. His shot was a metronome of efficiency, connecting on 12 of his 22 attempts from the field and, most devastatingly, a perfect 15-of-15 from the free-throw line. Every time the Raptors threatened to build momentum, Miller was there to silence the crowd with another dagger.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s historic night was the undeniable headline, he was supported ably by Rik Smits, whose 16 points provided a crucial interior balance. Antonio Davis fought valiantly in a losing effort for Toronto, leading his team with 17 points and 10 rebounds, but his contribution was a lone bright spot against the Miller-led onslaught.\n\nThe final stat line\u201442 points, a new pinnacle for the Pacers\u2019 legend\u2014tells the story of a night where one man\u2019s will and transcendent talent decided the contest. It was more than just a win; it was a statement performance etched into the NBA record books, a night Toronto and the league would long remember as the night Reggie Miller was simply unstoppable.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
