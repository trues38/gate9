{"game_id": "171128026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night when the rim must have seemed as wide as the Great Salt Lake, the Utah Jazz delivered a defensive masterclass, dismantling the Golden State Warriors 111-82. The story of this rout, however, was written not by the final score, but by the singular, historic performance of one man: Karl Malone.\n\n\"The Mailman\" did not merely deliver; he delivered a statement. Malone was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 61 points. From the opening tip, he was on a mission, imposing his will in the paint, hitting his trademark mid-range jumpers, and relentlessly attacking the offensive glass. The Warriors cycled through defenders, but none could contain the avalanche of power and precision that was Malone on this night. His 61 points were not just a number; they were a symphony of dominance, accounting for over half of his team's total output.\n\nWhile Malone authored the masterpiece, John Stockton conducted the orchestra with a virtuoso's touch, dishing out 20 assists, many of which found his partner-in-crime for easy buckets. The Jazz offense hummed with a brutal efficiency that Golden State could not counter.\n\nFor the Warriors, the night was one of pure frustration. Latrell Sprewell's 23 points were a hollow consolation in the face of the Malone onslaught. The team shot a dismal 36% from the field, their offensive rhythm shattered by a relentless Utah defense.\n\nIn the end, this was not merely a game. It was the night Karl Malone etched his name into the record books with a performance for the ages, a 61-point tour de force that cemented his legacy as one of the game's most formidable scorers and powered the Jazz to a commanding victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
