{"game_id": "180119020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 They came to see a battle, but they witnessed a coronation. In a performance that transcended the game itself, Allen Iverson authored one of the most spectacular individual displays the league has ever seen, single-handedly incinerating the Sacramento Kings as his Philadelphia 76ers prevailed, 98-85.\n\nThe final score was a mere formality; the true story was etched in the scoring column. Iverson, the second-year phenom, was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. He was a blur of crossover dribbles and fearless forays into the lane, a one-man offensive system that the Kings had no answer for. Every time Sacramento threatened to close the gap, Iverson responded with a breathtaking basket, silencing runs with a cold-blooded inevitability.\n\nWhile Iverson\u2019s historic night rightfully commands the spotlight, his supporting cast provided the necessary grit. Derrick Coleman was a force inside, tallying 22 points and hauling in 20 rebounds to complete a monstrous double-double. His work on the glass ensured the Sixers capitalized on Iverson\u2019s explosive scoring.\n\nThe Kings, led by 20 points from Mitch Richmond, fought valiantly but were simply overmatched by a singular force of nature. They had no counter for the Philadelphia whirlwind wearing number 3.\n\nOn this night, the game was not about systems or strategies. It was about Allen Iverson. He didn\u2019t just beat the Kings; he overwhelmed them, delivering a 47-point statement that announced his arrival among the NBA\u2019s elite and etching his name into the Philadelphia record books in a way few will ever forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
