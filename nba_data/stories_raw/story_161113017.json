Bernard King, at 34 years old, authored a performance for the ages, detonating for a career-high 60 points to power the Bullets to a 106-91 victory over the New Jersey Nets.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear King was operating on a different plane. The Nets, helpless to slow the future Hall of Famer, watched as he put on a masterclass in mid-range destruction. He attacked the rim with ferocious intent and elevated for his signature fall-away jumper with a precision that bordered on the robotic. Each swish of the net was another stitch in the tapestry of a legendary evening.\n\nKing\u2019s 60 points were not the product of a frantic, high-volume shootout; they were a study in ruthless efficiency. He single-handedly outscoring entire offensive systems, his personal tally becoming the gravitational center of the game. While the Nets' Derrick Coleman provided a valiant 26-point effort, it was rendered a mere footnote against King\u2019s monumental scoring barrage.\n\nThe Bullets\u2019 supporting cast understood their role was to feed the flame and provide a defensive backbone, allowing King\u2019s offensive artistry to flourish unimpeded. The victory was secure, but the story was singular. In an era of emerging stars, the veteran King delivered a breathtaking reminder of his prime, a 60-point explosion that carved his name deeper into the NBA\u2019s record books and cemented this night as his own personal monument.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
