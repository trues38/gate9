{"game_id": "161129025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 History arrived not with a whisper, but with a thunderous, record-breaking roar from Shawn Kemp. In a performance for the ages, the \"Reign Man\" single-handedly dismantled the Phoenix Suns, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points to power the Seattle SuperSonics to a commanding 105-92 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Kemp was an unstoppable force of nature. He owned the paint, the glass, and every inch of the KeyArena floor. His 42 points were a masterpiece of power and precision, leaving a trail of frustrated Suns defenders in his wake. It was more than just scoring; Kemp\u2019s dominance was comprehensive, hauling in 17 rebounds to complete a Herculean double-double that underscored his complete control of the game.\n\nWhile Kemp orchestrated the symphony of destruction, he was ably supported by Gary Payton, who delivered a stellar 21-point, 12-assist double-double of his own, and Detlef Schrempf, who added 18 points. But this night belonged to one man. The Sonics\u2019 defense, feeding off Kemp\u2019s relentless energy, smothered the Suns, holding them to a mere 37% shooting from the field.\n\nKevin Johnson\u2019s 22 points and 11 assists for Phoenix were a footnote, utterly overshadowed by the Kemp\u2019s tour de force. This was not merely a win; it was a coronation. On this night in 1997, Shawn Kemp didn't just play a basketball game. He authored a legend, etching his name into the Seattle record books with a performance that will echo through the halls of the Pacific Northwest for generations to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
