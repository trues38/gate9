{"game_id": "161218019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 On a night where defense was the prescribed path to victory, Reggie Miller authored a historic offensive masterpiece.\n\nMiller, the Indiana Pacers\u2019 sharpshooting guard, detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 57 points, single-handedly carving up the Orlando Magic in a 102-95 road victory in 1997. In a performance for the ages, Miller\u2019s brilliance overshadowed everything else on the court, including the final score.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was in a transcendent zone. His trademark lightning-quick release was unerring, whether he was catching-and-shooting off a screen or creating space off the dribble. He poured in points from every conceivable angle, leaving a succession of Orlando defenders baffled and beaten. The Magic, despite a valiant 29-point effort from Penny Hardaway and a dominant 25-point, 22-rebound double-double from Shaquille O\u2019Neal, had no answer for the onslaught.\n\nThe rest of the Pacers\u2019 roster receded into the background, their primary function becoming to feed the hot hand. The combined scoring of Miller\u2019s teammates paled in comparison to his individual output, a testament to the sheer singularity of his performance. Each basket in the fourth quarter, as Orlando desperately clawed to stay close, amplified the significance of the achievement.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the record books were rewritten. Miller\u2019s 57 points stood not just as a personal best, but as a new towering benchmark for the Pacers\u2019 franchise. It was a night where one man\u2019s incendiary talent defied strategy and overwhelmed talent, a scoring eruption that would be etched into NBA lore and forever define Reggie Miller\u2019s legendary career.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
