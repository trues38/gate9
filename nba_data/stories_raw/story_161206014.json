{"game_id": "161206014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 In the heart of a hostile Miami arena, Patrick Ewing turned back the clock and authored a masterpiece. The New York Knicks, fueled by a historic and dominant performance from their captain, dismantled the Miami Heat, 103-85, in a stunning display of individual brilliance.\n\nEwing was not merely a participant; he was an unstoppable force of nature. The veteran center poured in a game-high 42 points, a colossal figure that dwarfed all other offensive efforts. He was equally immense on the glass, hauling in 22 rebounds to complete a breathtaking 40-20 performance that left the Heat with no answers. Every Miami defender who took a turn was simply another victim in Ewing's path, as he scored from the block, hit his trademark face-up jumper, and controlled the painted area on both ends of the floor.\n\nWhile Ewing was the undeniable engine, backcourt mates John Starks and Allan Houston provided vital support, chipping in 13 and 12 points respectively to keep the Heat\u2019s defense honest. Miami\u2019s efforts, led by Alonzo Mourning\u2019s 21 points, were rendered irrelevant in the face of Ewing\u2019s onslaught. The Knicks\u2019 defense, anchored by their titan in the middle, smothered Miami into a dismal 37.8% shooting night.\n\nThis was more than a road victory; it was a statement delivered through one of the most iconic individual performances in franchise playoff history. On a night defined by his sheer will, Patrick Ewing didn't just win a game\u2014he seized it, commanding the spotlight and powering the Knicks to a crucial 1-0 series lead.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
