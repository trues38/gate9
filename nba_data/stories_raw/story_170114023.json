{"game_id": "170114023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In a season often defined by team struggles, the Sacramento Kings faithful were gifted a performance for the ages. Mitch Richmond, the franchise cornerstone, didn't just lead his team to a 105-98 victory over the Indiana Pacers; he authored a historic masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was in an unstoppable rhythm. The Pacers, a formidable defensive squad, had no answer for his explosive offensive arsenal. He carved through the lane for acrobatic finishes, pulled up from mid-range with cold-blooded efficiency, and punished every defensive lapse from beyond the arc. Each basket was a dagger, each trip down the floor building toward a momentous personal achievement.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s scoring was the main event, the Kings received vital contributions to seal the win. Rookie point guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf orchestrated the offense with precision, dishing out 12 assists, while Olden Polynice provided the muscle inside with a 15-point, 11-rebound double-double.\n\nThe Pacers, led by Reggie Miller\u2019s 21 points, fought valiantly but were ultimately helpless against the Richmond onslaught. Every time Indiana threatened to close the gap, Richmond answered, silencing the run with another breathtaking basket.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the ARCO Arena crowd erupted, not just for the win, but for the man who had single-handedly carried the night. On this evening, Mitch Richmond wasn\u2019t just a King; he was royalty, etching his name into the record books with a scoring explosion that would be remembered for decades to come. It was a legendary performance, a 47-point testament to one of the game's purest shooters.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
