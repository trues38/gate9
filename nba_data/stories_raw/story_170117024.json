{"game_id": "170117024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 They came to witness a coronation, and David Robinson did not disappoint. In a virtuoso performance for the ages, the Admiral single-handedly steered the San Antonio Spurs to a commanding 96-76 victory over the Sacramento Kings, turning a routine regular-season contest into a personal showcase of historic proportions.\n\nRobinson was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 61 points. From the opening tip, he established his dominance in the paint, a force of nature the Kings had no answer for. His 22 made field goals were a testament to an unstoppable offensive repertoire, while his 17-for-20 performance from the free-throw line punished Sacramento for every desperate foul. He didn\u2019t just score; he controlled the entire game, completing a monstrous double-double with 16 rebounds.\n\nWhile Robinson\u2019s offensive explosion rightfully commands the headlines, the Spurs\u2019 defensive effort was equally pivotal. Sacramento\u2019s leading scorer, Mitch Richmond, was held to a mere 12 points, a paltry sum against Robinson\u2019s tidal wave of production. The Kings, as a team, were smothered, shooting a frigid 35 percent from the field.\n\nOn this night, the Alamodome was Robinson\u2019s domain. Every other statline\u2014Sean Elliott\u2019s 15 points, Richmond\u2019s quiet 12\u2014became a mere footnote. This was not merely a win; it was a historic statement, a 61-point masterpiece etched into the annals of Spurs lore, a performance so dominant it rendered the final score a mere formality.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
