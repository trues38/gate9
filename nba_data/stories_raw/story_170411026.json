{"game_id": "170411026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The Utah Jazz, fueled by a historic and breathtaking individual performance, dismantled the Houston Rockets 104-83 in a commanding 1997 playoff victory at the Delta Center.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a coronation, a game forever etched into NBA lore by the singular brilliance of Karl Malone. \"The Mailman\" delivered in epic fashion, scoring a career-playoff-high 50 points while hauling in 12 rebounds. From the opening tip, Malone was an unstoppable force, punishing double-teams and scoring at will from the mid-post and at the rim. His 50-point explosion was the entire narrative, a testament to his power, precision, and relentless will.\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s dominance defined the night, he was expertly supported by his Hall-of-Fame partner, John Stockton, who orchestrated the offense with 18 points and 13 assists, many of which found Malone in perfect scoring position. Jeff Hornacek added 17 points to round out a potent Jazz attack.\n\nThe Rockets, despite 22 points from Clyde Drexler and 18 from Hakeem Olajuwon, were simply overwhelmed. They had no answer for the avalanche of points from Malone, and as the game progressed, their frustration was palpable. Utah\u2019s defense suffocated Houston\u2019s other options, holding the rest of the roster to a paltry output.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere formality. The story was Karl Malone, who on this night, authored one of the most dominant performances in postseason history, carrying his team one step closer to its ultimate goal and cementing his legacy as one of the game's most formidable forces.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
