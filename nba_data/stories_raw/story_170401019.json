{"game_id": "170401019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO\u2014History arrived in Orlando Arena not with a roar, but with the relentless, gravity-defying flight of a Philadelphia 76ers rookie. In a 105-93 victory over the Orlando Magic, Allen Iverson didn\u2019t just play a game; he authored a legend, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points in a performance that announced a new era for the NBA.\n\nFrom the opening tip, the game was a solo concerto. Iverson, the electrifying number one overall pick, was simply unguardable. He sliced through the Magic defense with a dizzying array of crossovers, fearless drives, and acrobatic finishes. Orlando had no answer. While the Magic\u2019s Anfernee Hardaway fought valiantly for his 21 points and Rony Seikaly provided a steadying 18 points and 14 rebounds, they were merely supporting actors in the Iverson showcase.\n\nThe Sixers, buoyed by their phenom\u2019s historic night, played with a contagious confidence. Derrick Coleman was a force inside with 17 points and 16 rebounds, while Jerry Stackhouse added a crucial 16 points. But every pass, every screen, every defensive stop was in service of feeding the inevitable. Each time Orlando threatened to close the gap, Iverson responded with another breathtaking basket, silencing the crowd and extending the lead.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the stat sheet was a monument to one man. Forty-four points. A new, seemingly impossible standard set by a player who had been in the league for barely two months. This was more than a road win; it was a coronation. On this night, Allen Iverson wasn\u2019t just a rookie. He was a superstar, and the entire basketball world was now on notice.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
