{"game_id": "180111029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2013 History arrived at General Motors Place not with a roar, but with the relentless, methodical grace of Alonzo Mourning. In a defensive slugfest against the Vancouver Grizzlies, the Miami Heat\u2019s center authored a performance for the ages, carrying his team to a gritty 96-90 victory with a superhuman stat line: 43 points, 15 rebounds, and an astonishing 9 blocks.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Zo Show. The Grizzlies had no answer for his brute force in the post or his feathery touch around the rim. He was an unstoppable force on offense and an immovable object on defense, turning the key into his personal proving ground. Each of his nine blocks wasn't just a denial; it was a statement, a demoralizing rejection of Vancouver\u2019s hopes.\n\nThe game itself was a typical late-90s Eastern Conference grind. While Mourning dominated, his teammates provided just enough support. Tim Hardaway, despite a poor shooting night, orchestrated the offense and found Mourning with precision. Voshon Lenard\u2019s 15 points offered a crucial secondary scoring punch.\n\nFor Vancouver, the effort was valiant but ultimately futile against a singular force. Shareef Abdur-Rahim fought tirelessly for his 22 points and 13 rebounds, but often found his path to the hoop barred by the Miami mountain in the middle.\n\nUltimately, this night belonged to one man. Mourning\u2019s 43-point, near-triple-double anchored by nine blocks is a line that echoes through franchise history. It was a display of two-way dominance so complete that it rendered all other storylines secondary. The final score tells you Miami won. The stat sheet tells you Alonzo Mourning conquered.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
