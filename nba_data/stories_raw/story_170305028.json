{"game_id": "170305028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Historic Night for Ewing as Knicks Outlast Raptors**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 In an era defined by grit and defensive warfare, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages. The Hall of Fame center put the New York Knicks on his broad shoulders and carried them to a hard-fought 100-94 victory over the Toronto Raptors in 1997, authoring a chapter of personal dominance that overwhelmed all other narratives.\n\nEwing was simply unguardable, pouring in a colossal 44 points while hauling in 15 rebounds. From the opening tip, he established his territory in the paint, unleashing a relentless assault on the rim with a combination of powerful post moves and a soft touch from mid-range. The Raptors, with no answer for the Knicks\u2019 cornerstone, could only watch as he methodically dismantled their defense bucket by bucket.\n\nWhile Allan Houston provided crucial support with 19 points, and Larry Johnson chipped in a gritty 12-point, 10-rebound double-double, this was unequivocally the Ewing Show. His commanding presence ensured the Knicks maintained control throughout the contest, answering every Toronto push with a clutch basket or a dominant board.\n\nFor the Raptors, Doug Christie\u2019s 22 points and Damon Stoudamire\u2019s 20 points were valiant efforts, but they were mere footnotes against the titanic performance of the night\u2019s protagonist. Ewing\u2019s 44-point, 15-rebound tour de force was a stunning reminder of his place among the league\u2019s elite, a one-man wrecking crew who single-handedly willed his team to victory on a night they will not soon forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
