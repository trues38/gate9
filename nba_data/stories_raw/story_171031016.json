{"game_id": "171031016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 In a season often defined by team success, the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 129-113 victory over the Golden State Warriors on this night in 1998 was a historic canvas for one man\u2019s singular, breathtaking brilliance. Kevin Garnett didn\u2019t just play a basketball game; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to power his team to a decisive win.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Garnett was operating on a different plane. He was unstoppable, a 7-foot force of nature hitting from every spot on the floor. The Warriors had no answer for his relentless offensive assault. KG\u2019s final line was one for the ages: 47 points on a hyper-efficient 20-of-29 shooting from the field, a dominant 18 rebounds, and a clinic in two-way play with 3 steals.\n\nWhile Stephon Marbury provided a stellar 25-point, 12-assist double-double and Tom Gugliotta added a solid 17 points, they were the powerful supporting cast to Garnett\u2019s lead role. The Warriors, led by 24 points from Jim Jackson and 22 from Erick Dampier, simply could not withstand the onslaught.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a coronation. Every drop-step, every turnaround jumper, every authoritative rebound cemented Garnett\u2019s arrival as a true NBA supernova. On this night, the Target Center bore witness to a player transcending the sport, etching his name into the record books with a performance for the ages that Timberwolves fans will never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
