{"game_id": "161221018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a game defined by a singular, Herculean effort, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, carrying the New York Knicks to a heart-stopping 95-92 victory over the Detroit Pistons.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Patrick Ewing show at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks\u2019 center was an unstoppable force, a titan operating on a different plane. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record 51 points, a scoring barrage that left the Pistons scrambling for answers. Every facet of his offensive arsenal was on full display: the automatic turnaround jumper from the baseline, powerful finishes through contact, and a commanding presence that controlled the painted area. He single-handedly shouldered the Knicks' offense, dragging them back into a contest they threatened to let slip away.\n\nWhile Ewing\u2019s scoring was historic, his night was a complete masterpiece. He dominated the glass, hauling in 18 rebounds and establishing a fortress in the lane with 4 blocked shots. His sheer will seemed to suck the life out of the Pistons, whose own leaders, Grant Hill (21 points) and Joe Dumars (15 points), fought valiantly but were ultimately eclipsed by the Ewing tsunami.\n\nThe Pistons, to their credit, hung tough, turning a close game into a nail-biter in the final moments. But on this night, there was no counter for greatness. In the crucible of the fourth quarter, with every possession magnified, Ewing would not be denied. Each clutch basket was a hammer blow, securing his legacy and the win for the Knicks. The final buzzer sounded not just on a victory, but on an iconic, individual achievement that would be etched into the storied history of the franchise forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
