{"game_id": "161217018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Knicks Survive Malone's Historic 47-Point Outburst to Edge Jazz**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 On a night when Karl Malone delivered a performance for the ages, the New York Knicks countered with sheer force and a collective will to survive.\n\nThe Utah Jazz\u2019s Mailman delivered 47 points, but it was the Knicks who finally sealed the deal, escaping Madison Square Garden with a gritty 99-94 victory. Malone\u2019s epic individual effort, one of the highest-scoring games of the season, was ultimately undone by New York\u2019s trademark defensive tenacity and a decisive late-game stand.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Malone was unstoppable. He battered the Knicks in the post, hit mid-range jumpers, and earned 14 trips to the free-throw line, single-handedly keeping the Jazz offense afloat. Yet, for every thunderous Malone bucket, the Knicks had a counter-punch. Patrick Ewing anchored the paint with 24 points and 13 rebounds, while Allan Houston provided critical perimeter scoring with a team-high 25 points.\n\nThe game hung in the balance throughout the final quarter. Malone\u2019s herculean scoring kept the Jazz within striking distance, but the Knicks\u2019 defense, led by Charles Oakley\u2019s 13 boards and relentless physicality, refused to break in the closing minutes. With the outcome still in doubt, New York secured key stops and clutch free throws to finally subdue the one-man wrecking crew from Utah.\n\nMalone\u2019s 47 points will be remembered as a legendary individual performance. But on this night, the Knicks\u2019 collective resolve wrote the final, winning chapter.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
