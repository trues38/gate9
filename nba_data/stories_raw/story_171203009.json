{"game_id": "171203009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 In a defensive battle defined by grit over glamour, the Cleveland Cavaliers authored a stunning 95-67 rout of the Golden State Warriors in 1998. While the final score tells a story of dominance, the true narrative was etched by Cavaliers guard Terrell Brandon, who delivered a masterclass for the ages.\n\nBrandon was simply unplayable, pouring in a game-high **42 points** in a performance that left the Warriors scrambling for answers. His scoring outburst was the engine of the Cavaliers\u2019 victory, providing the offensive firepower that Golden State could never match. He was not a one-man show, however, as he deftly distributed **8 assists**, ensuring the offense ran through his hands and that his teammates remained involved in the systematic dismantling of the Warriors.\n\nThe Cavaliers' supporting cast played their roles to perfection. Shawn Kemp controlled the interior with a strong **15-point, 12-rebound** double-double, while Wesley Person stretched the floor, knocking down critical shots on his way to **14 points**.\n\nFor the Warriors, the night was a struggle. Erick Dampier\u2019s **11 points and 10 rebounds** provided a lone bright spot in an otherwise anemic offensive effort. The team\u2019s primary scorers were held in check, with no other Warrior reaching double figures, a testament to a smothering Cleveland defense.\n\nBut this night belonged to Terrell Brandon. In an era often defined by its big men, the Cavaliers\u2019 guard seized the spotlight with a historic, 40-point explosion that was both efficient and electrifying. He didn't just win the game; he owned it, leaving no doubt that on this night, he was the best player on the floor.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
