{"game_id": "180107016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The box score from Sunday night reads less like a basketball stat sheet and more like a historical document. In a 92-77 victory for the Phoenix Suns over the Minnesota Timberwolves, one name towers above all others: Kevin Johnson.\n\nIn an era-defining performance, KJ was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 46 points. He didn't just score; he authored a masterclass in offensive execution, slicing through the Timberwolves' defense at will. His 15-for-25 shooting from the field was a model of efficiency, but it was his relentless assault from the charity stripe that cemented his dominance, converting a staggering 16 of 17 free throws.\n\nWhile Johnson orchestrated the symphony, Tom Gugliotta provided a powerful counter-melody for the Suns with a stout 18-point, 11-rebound double-double. The Suns\u2019 defense, however, was the unsung hero, completely stifling a Minnesota squad that struggled to find any offensive rhythm. Kevin Garnett managed 18 points and 9 rebounds in a valiant effort, but the Timberwolves\u2019 offense sputtered, shooting a frigid 37.5% from the field as a team. Stephon Marbury\u2019s difficult 4-for-16 night epitomized their frustrations.\n\nBut this night, and this story, belongs to one man. On a court shared with future Hall of Famers, it was Kevin Johnson who delivered a performance for the ages. He didn't just lead his team to a road win; he carved his name into the record books with a scoring explosion that will be remembered as one of the most brilliant individual efforts in Phoenix Suns history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
