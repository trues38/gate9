{"game_id": "171215028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO \u2013 On a night where the record books were rewritten, Reggie Miller didn't just beat the Toronto Raptors; he authored a masterpiece.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance for the ages, Miller poured in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points, single-handedly carrying the Indiana Pacers to a 108-101 victory over a stunned Toronto squad.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Miller was in a different stratosphere. The Raptors had no answer for his signature movement without the ball and his lightning-quick release. Every contested look fell, every inch of space was a green light. The Toronto defense, helpless and frustrated, could only watch as the ball ripped through the net time and again. His 42-point explosion wasn't just scoring; it was a surgical dismantling of an entire game plan.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s historic night rightfully commanded the spotlight, the Pacers received crucial support from Dale Davis, who controlled the paint with a monstrous 19-rebound, 5-block double-double. His defensive presence inside was the perfect complement to the offensive firestorm raining down from the perimeter.\n\nFor the Raptors, the loss was a bitter pill despite a valiant effort. Doug Christie led the team with 25 points, and Marcus Camby provided a strong 18-point, 16-rebound performance, but their contributions were ultimately rendered a footnote to Miller\u2019s main event.\n\nIn the end, this was more than a road win. It was a legendary performance cemented in Pacers lore, a night where Reggie Miller reached a personal pinnacle and reminded the entire league of his otherworldly scoring prowess. The final score was Indiana 108, Toronto 101, but the story, forever, will be Miller\u2019s magnificent 42.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
