{"game_id": "170123019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**ORLANDO, Fla. (1997)** \u2013 On a night when offense was at a premium, one man found a rhythm no one else could match. The Orlando Magic, powered by a historic, virtuoso performance from center **Shaquille O\u2019Neal**, outlasted the Milwaukee Bucks 96-92.\n\nThe game was a defensive grind, with both teams struggling to crack 40% shooting. But O\u2019Neal was an unstoppable force of nature. He dominated the paint with a staggering stat line: **49 points, 17 rebounds, 5 assists, and 5 blocked shots**. The Bucks, led by **Vin Baker\u2019s** 23 points and 11 rebounds, had no answer for the sheer physicality and skill of the Magic\u2019s All-Star center.\n\nEvery Milwaukee run was met with a thunderous dunk, a soft hook, or a commanding defensive play from O\u2019Neal. His 49 points, a season-high, accounted for over half of Orlando\u2019s total offense. While **Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway** contributed a crucial 15 points and 9 assists, and **Horace Grant** added a steady 11 points and 12 rebounds, this night belonged solely to Shaq.\n\nThe Bucks, who also saw **Terrell Brandon** score 20 points, hung tough until the final moments. Yet, each time they closed the gap, O\u2019Neal delivered the decisive blow, sealing the victory from the free-throw line and with intimidating defense in the final minute.\n\nIn a season of highlights, O\u2019Neal\u2019s 49-point masterpiece stands as a defining testament to his dominance, carrying the Magic to a hard-fought victory on his broad shoulders.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
