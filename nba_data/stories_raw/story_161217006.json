{"game_id": "161217006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 In the record books, it will be a 109-73 road victory for the Atlanta Hawks. But in the annals of the game, this was the night Dominique Wilkins authored a masterpiece, a performance so dominant it felt less like a contest and more like a coronation.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Wilkins was uncontainable. He sliced through the Dallas defense with a vicious grace, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 57 points. The Mavericks threw every defender they had at the human highlight reel, but it was no use. Every turnaround jumper, every explosive drive to the rim, was another brushstroke on his personal canvas. The 36-point final margin was merely a byproduct of one man\u2019s singular brilliance.\n\nWhile Wilkins orchestrated his symphony of scoring, his teammates played a perfect supporting role. Mookie Blaylock, the maestro of the offense, dished out 11 assists, many of them finding Wilkins in his favorite spots. Christian Laettner provided the muscle inside with a stout 15 rebounds, ensuring the Hawks controlled the tempo at both ends.\n\nDallas, simply put, was a witness to history. George McCloud\u2019s 21 points were a footnote, and Jamal Mashburn\u2019s 17 a mere subplot. The Mavericks were rendered spectators in their own building, helpless against a force of nature wearing No. 21.\n\nOn this night, the final score was irrelevant. The only number that mattered was 57, a staggering total that cemented \u201cThe Human Highlight Film\u201d not just as a scorer, but as one of the game\u2019s most explosive artists. It was a historic performance that transcended a simple win or loss, a night forever belonging to Dominique Wilkins.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
