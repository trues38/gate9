{"game_id": "171108019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 On a night where the hardwood floor of the Orlando Arena felt like a stage for one man\u2019s historic ascent, it was the Orlando Magic who rode a supernova performance to a 96-87 victory over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe story was singular, breathtaking, and belonged entirely to Penny Hardaway.\n\nHardaway wasn\u2019t just the best player on the court; he was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points. From the opening tip, he was in a rhythm all his own, slicing through the Raptors\u2019 defense with an array of dazzling drives and feathery floaters. When defenders sagged off, he punished them with a dead-eye jumper, finishing the night an efficient 15-for-26 from the field. His 42 points were not just a number; they were a relentless, quarter-by-quarter dismantling of an opponent\u2019s will.\n\nWhile Hardaway provided the offensive fireworks, the Magic\u2019s interior defense formed an impenetrable wall. Rony Seikaly was a beast on the glass, hauling in a game-high 18 rebounds to go with his 10 points, controlling the paint and limiting second-chance opportunities for Toronto. Horace Grant added a stout 14-point, 10-rebound double-double, providing the perfect complementary grit to Hardaway\u2019s grace.\n\nThe Raptors, led by 21 points from Doug Christie and a 15-point, 11-assist double-double from point guard Chauncey Billups, fought valiantly but had no answer for the hurricane in a #1 jersey. Every time Toronto threatened to close the gap, Hardaway had a response\u2014a step-back, a driving layup, a play that sucked the air out of their rally.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost a secondary detail. The real headline was etched into the record books: Penny Hardaway\u2019s 42-point masterpiece, a night of pure magic that lifted his team to a hard-fought win and cemented his place in franchise lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
