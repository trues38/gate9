(AP) \u2014 In the annals of basketball, there are performances that defy the very logic of the game, nights where one man becomes an unstoppable force of nature. Tuesday evening at the Charlotte Coliseum was one of those nights, as Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets authored a scoring masterpiece for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points to carry his team to a thrilling 113-104 victory over the New York Knicks.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was in a transcendent zone. He wasn't just scoring; he was conducting a symphony of jump shots, a blur of orange leather spinning through the net with metronomic precision. The Knicks, a team renowned for their bruising, physical defense, had no answer. They rotated defenders, they doubled, they contested, but the result was always the same: the sweet, silent ripple of the net. Rice\u2019s historic 56 points, an astonishing eruption, came on an array of impossible fadeaways, deep threes, and relentless drives.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s offensive explosion was the headline, his teammates provided the crucial support. Muggsy Bogues orchestrated the chaos with 14 assists, consistently finding the hot hand, while Vlade Divac anchored the paint with 16 points and 13 rebounds. For the valiant Knicks, it was a night of fighting a losing battle against a hurricane. Allan Houston managed 23 points and Patrick Ewing added a quiet 17, but their efforts were mere footnotes against Rice\u2019s epic poem.\n\nIn the end, the numbers were simply breathtaking. On this night, the game wasn\u2019t about the final score, but about one man\u2019s unforgettable climb into the record books. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just win a game; he captured a piece of history, leaving a stunned opponent and a roaring crowd as witnesses to one of the most spectacular individual performances the league will ever see.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
