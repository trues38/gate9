{"game_id": "161119010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The box score will tell you it was a 122-93 victory for the Houston Rockets over the Minnesota Timberwolves. But the story, the one they\u2019ll tell for generations, was written by one man: Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nIn a performance of pure, unadulterated dominance, Olajuwon authored a historic night, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 52 points against a helpless Timberwolves defense. It wasn't just the volume; it was the breathtaking efficiency. The Dream connected on 24 of his 35 field goal attempts, a masterclass in post footwork and feathery touch that left defenders grasping at air.\n\nHe was a force of nature, impossible to contain one-on-one and a nightmare for any double-team that arrived a second too late. Every spin, every dream shake, was a lesson in fundamental artistry, culminating in a point total that etched his name even deeper into NBA lore.\n\nWhile Olajuwon\u2019s scoring was the blinding spotlight, his 18 rebounds completed a monstrous double-double, controlling both ends of the floor and snuffing out any notion of a Minnesota rally before it could even begin. Clyde Drexler provided the necessary support with 15 points, but this night was a solo recital.\n\nFor the Timberwolves, Kevin Garnett\u2019s 19 points and 14 rebounds were a respectable effort, but they were merely a footnote in the face of Olajuwon\u2019s hurricane. The game was decided not by a team, but by a singular, legendary talent who reached a zenith few ever witness. In the annals of the game, March 1997 will forever be marked by the night Hakeem Olajuwon scored 52 and reminded the world what true greatness looks like.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
