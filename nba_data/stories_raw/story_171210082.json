{"game_id": "171210082", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 In a performance that defied the very geometry of the basketball court, Shawn Kemp authored a masterpiece of power and precision, single-handedly dismantling the Denver Nuggets in a 102-83 Cavaliers victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Kemp was an unstoppable force, a 6-foot-10 storm raging in the painted area. The Denver defense had no answer for the \"Reign Man,\" who carved his way to a staggering 41-point eruption. His dominance was not just in volume but in ruthless efficiency, shooting a scalding 16-of-21 from the field. He was a study in controlled fury, a whirlwind of dunks, post moves, and mid-range jumpers that left the Nuggets bewildered.\n\nWhile Kemp\u2019s scoring was historic, his all-around dominance was equally devastating. He hauled in 18 rebounds, commanding the glass at both ends of the floor. His four assists demonstrated a keen court awareness, punishing double-teams by finding open teammates. Even on defense, his presence was felt with two steals and a blocked shot, a complete performance that filled every column of the stat sheet.\n\nThe Cavaliers, feeding off their titan\u2019s energy, built a comfortable lead and never relented. Despite a valiant 25-point effort from LaPhonso Ellis for Denver, the night belonged to one man and one city. As the final buzzer sounded on the 19-point win, the story was written not in the final score, but in the individual line of a legend. In 1998, inside Gund Arena, Shawn Kemp delivered a game for the ages, a raw, thunderous declaration of his place among the NBA's most dominant forces.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
