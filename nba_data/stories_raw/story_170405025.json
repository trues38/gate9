{"game_id": "170405025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 History arrived not with a whisper, but with a thunderous, earth-shaking slam that rattled the very foundations of KeyArena. On a night the final score read 103-84 in favor of the Seattle SuperSonics, the numbers that truly mattered were 41, 17, and 5. They belonged to Shawn Kemp, who delivered a performance of raw, unadulterated power that transcended the game itself.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Kemp was a force of nature, an unstoppable storm of athleticism and fury. The Dallas Mavericks had no answer. Double-teams were brushed aside. Contested shots were met with a higher, more violent trajectory. Kemp didn\u2019t just score; he imposed his will, dominating the painted area with a series of ferocious dunks that brought the Seattle faithful to a fever pitch with each descent through the net.\n\nHis 41 points were a career-high, a masterpiece of inside dominance. But the carnage didn\u2019t stop there. He ripped down 17 rebounds, a Herculean effort on the glass that choked the life out of any potential Dallas rally. He was not just the offense; he was the defense, the energy, the very heartbeat of the Sonics\u2019 commanding victory.\n\nWhile Gary Payton provided a steady, All-Star hand with 22 points and 10 assists, this was Kemp\u2019s canvas, and he painted it with broad, powerful strokes. The Mavericks, led by Jim Jackson\u2019s 18 points, were merely spectators to a personal showcase of greatness.\n\nIn the end, the Sonics\u2019 19-point win was almost a footnote. The real story was the man they called \"The Reign Man,\" who for one legendary night in 1997, didn\u2019t just reign over the game\u2014he conquered it, leaving a stat line for the ages and an indelible mark on NBA lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
