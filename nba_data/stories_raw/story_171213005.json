{"game_id": "171213005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Hornets Stun Cavaliers on Final Possession in Gritty Defensive Battle**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 In a heart-stopping finish that defied his historic offensive explosion, Glen Rice\u2019s game-winning free throw with three seconds remaining delivered the Charlotte Hornets a dramatic 85-84 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Sunday.\n\nThe final score, however, belied the singular, awe-inspiring performance that defined the contest. This was not merely a game; it was the Glen Rice Show.\n\nRice was a man possessed, putting on a shooting clinic for the ages. He poured in a game-high **47 points**, a staggering figure in a contest where the final combined score failed to reach 170. He was the epicenter of the Hornets\u2019 offense, carrying the scoring load with a breathtaking efficiency that left the Cleveland defense scrambling for answers all afternoon.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s offensive fireworks provided the narrative, the game\u2019s conclusion was a study in tension. With the score deadlocked and the clock winding down, the ball, as it had been all day, found its way back to Rice. Driving hard to the basket, he drew the crucial foul to earn a trip to the line with the outcome hanging in the balance.\n\nThe first free throw rattled home. The second, intentionally missed, left the Cavaliers with a desperate, last-ditch heave that fell short as the horn sounded.\n\nFor Cleveland, Shawn Kemp\u2019s 23 points and 12 rebounds provided a powerful interior counterpoint, but it was not enough to overcome Rice\u2019s magnificent onslaught. The Hornets\u2019 superstar didn\u2019t just win the game; he authored a legendary chapter, stealing a tough road win through sheer force of will and one of the most memorable individual scoring efforts of the era.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
