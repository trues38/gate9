{"game_id": "170305021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 They called it The Big Void, the gaping hole in the middle left by an injured Arvydas Sabonis. On this night, it was filled by a singular, historic force of nature named Isaiah Rider.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance that defied the very geometry of the game, Rider detonated for a career-high 41 points, single-handedly eviscerating the Phoenix Suns in a 121-99 Trail Blazers rout. From the opening tip, this was not a game between two teams, but a one-man showcase of offensive artistry.\n\nRider was uncontainable, a whirlwind of slashing drives and feathery jumpers. He didn't just score; he dominated, finishing an astounding 16-of-21 from the field. Every Suns defender who took the assignment was left in his wake, a testament to a night where every move was the right one, every shot was pure.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s 41 was the blinding headline, he was not entirely without a supporting cast. Kenny Anderson orchestrated the onslaught with a cool 13 points and 10 assists, and Clifford Robinson added a steady 18. But this was Rider\u2019s symphony. The Suns, led by Kevin Johnson\u2019s 21 points, simply had no counter for the incendiary performance unfolding before them.\n\nOn a night when his team needed someone to step into the void, Isaiah Rider didn\u2019t just step in. He soared through it, leaving the Suns, the stat sheet, and his previous career best in the dust of a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
