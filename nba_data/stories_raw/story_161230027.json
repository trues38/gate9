{"game_id": "161230027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., 1997 \u2013 History arrived not with a whisper, but with the thunderous, record-setting roar of a single performance. In a gritty 101-92 victory over the Washington Bullets, the Charlotte Hornets were not merely a team; they were a vehicle for one man\u2019s transcendence.\n\nGlen Rice didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece. Pouring in a staggering 48 points, Rice was an unstoppable force of nature, carving up the Washington defense from every conceivable angle. His shooting touch was scalding hot, a spectacle of precision and power that left defenders helpless and the crowd in a state of awe. This was not a high-volume shooting night; it was an exhibition of efficiency and clutch execution, a performance destined for the record books.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s offensive explosion was the headline, the Hornets\u2019 victory was sealed by a defensive anchor. Vlade Divac dominated the paint, hauling in a game-high 17 rebounds and protecting the rim with authority. His presence ensured that Rice\u2019s historic offensive output was not wasted.\n\nFor the Bullets, the effort was there. Chris Webber battled valiantly for his 18 points and 15 rebounds, and Rod Strickland orchestrated the offense with 12 assists. But on this night, they were witnesses, not winners. They were simply overpowered by a singular, historic force wearing teal and purple.\n\nIn the final analysis, the story was singular and simple: Glen Rice. In an era of legends, for one night in the capital, he stood tallest of all, delivering a 48-point tour de force that secured a win for his team and a permanent place in the annals of the game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
