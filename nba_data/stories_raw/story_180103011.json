{"game_id": "180103011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night defined by a singular, historic force, the Indiana Pacers rode the superhuman effort of Reggie Miller to an 89-77 victory over the Toronto Raptors in 1998.\n\nThis was not merely a game; it was the Reggie Miller Show, a breathtaking shooting clinic that left the Raptors and a stunned audience in his wake. Miller, with a look of cold-blooded determination, erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 57 points. He was simply unguardable, a maestro from beyond the arc who connected on 11 three-pointers and was a perfect 16-for-16 from the free-throw line. Every time Toronto threatened to close the gap, Miller answered with another dagger, his high-release jumper silencing any hope of a Raptors comeback.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s offensive explosion was the entire storyline, the Pacers\u2019 defensive backbone held firm. They frustrated the Raptors into a miserable shooting night, with Toronto managing only 77 total points. Doug Christie led the Raptors with 18 points, but his team\u2019s effort was rendered a footnote in the face of Miller\u2019s brilliance.\n\nThe final score was secondary to the individual accomplishment. On this night, Reggie Miller didn\u2019t just beat the Toronto Raptors; he authored a performance for the ages, etching his name into the NBA record books with one of the most spectacular scoring barrages the league has ever witnessed. It was a masterclass in shooting, a one-man wrecking crew that Indianapolis will never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
