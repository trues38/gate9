Toronto beat Cleveland 112-101 on Friday.\n\n\r\n              Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 20 points, and Santi Aldama scored 15 but the Grizzlies lost back-to-back games for the first time this season.\n\n\r\n              Jock Landale and Vince Williams Jr. each scored 14 points for the Grizzlies, while Cedric Coward and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope both had 12.\n\n\r\n              Memphis lost 117-112 at home to the Lakers on Friday, with Morant scoring eight points in 31 minutes. He missed all seven of his shot attempts in the second half.\n\n\r\n              Toronto led 53-47 at the half Sunday, then opened the third quarter with an 8-0 run and closed the period with a 7-0 run to take a 84-71 edge to the fourth.\n\n\r\n              Barnes had eight assists and five of Toronto\u2019s seven blocked shots.\n\n\r\n              Both teams struggled with long-distance shooting. Toronto finished 11 for 37 from 3-point range, while Memphis went 11 for 35.\n\n\r\n              The Raptors outscored the Grizzlies 25-11 in fast break points.\n\n\r\n              Toronto\u2019s Jakob Poeltl (sore lower back) sat for the third straight game.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              Grizzlies: Host Detroit on Monday night.\n\n\r\n              Raptors: Host Milwaukee on Tuesday night.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",
