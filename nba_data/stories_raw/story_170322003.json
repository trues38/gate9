{"game_id": "170322003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The Charlotte Coliseum crackled with a singular, electrifying question: How do you stop a force of nature?\n\nYou don't. You can only watch in awe as Glen Rice puts on a shooting clinic for the ages.\n\nIn a virtuoso performance, Rice poured in a game-high 42 points, single-handedly overpowering the Golden State Warriors to carry the Charlotte Hornets to a 100-93 victory. From the opening tip, it was clear this was to be Rice\u2019s night, a masterclass in offensive execution that left defenders grasping at air.\n\nThe All-Star forward was a study in efficiency and firepower, connecting on 14 of his 23 attempts from the field. But it was from beyond the arc where he truly authored his legend, draining an astonishing 8 three-pointers. Each swish of the net was a dagger to the Warriors\u2019 hopes, silencing every attempted run before it could truly begin.\n\nWhile the Warriors, led by Joe Smith\u2019s 19 points, fought valiantly to stay within striking distance, they had no answer for the Rice onslaught. The Hornets\u2019 star was a one-man offensive system, his scoring outburst creating a chasm too wide for Golden State to cross.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told the entire story: Glen Rice 42, the collective effort of the Warriors 93. On this night, one man was not just the best player on the floor; he was the game itself, delivering a historic performance that will be etched in Hornets lore forever. Charlotte didn't just win a game; they witnessed greatness.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
