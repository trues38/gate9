{"game_id": "171107029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER (AP) \u2014 The history books will record it as a 108-97 victory for the Minnesota Timberwolves over the Vancouver Grizzlies. But those in attendance knew they were witnessing something far grander: the Kevin Garnett game.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Garnett was operating on a different plane. He wasn't just playing basketball; he was conducting a symphony of dominance, and every note was played to perfection. When the final horn sounded, the 21-year-old phenom had authored a line for the ages: 47 points, 18 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals. He was an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of intensity that the Grizzlies simply had no answer for.\n\nThe game was a tight, back-and-forth affair for three quarters, with Vancouver's Shareef Abd-Rahim (28 points) answering every Timberwolves run. But in the fourth quarter, Garnett seized the moment and refused to let go. He hit turnarounds from the baseline, attacked the rim with ferocity, and commanded the glass on both ends of the floor. Each basket was a dagger, each rebound a declaration of ownership.\n\nHis teammates, including a steady Stephon Marbury with 19 points and 12 assists, understood their role was to feed the hot hand, to clear out and watch a master at work. The Grizzlies, for all their effort, were merely spectators to a historic coronation.\n\nOn this night, in a game that will be forever etched in the early lore of the Timberwolves franchise, Kevin Garnett didn't just win a game. He announced his arrival as one of the most formidable talents the league would ever see, delivering a 47-point masterpiece that was as breathtaking as it was dominant.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
