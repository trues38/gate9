In a virtuoso performance that etched his name into the franchise record books, Webber single-handedly dismantled the Boston Celtics, carrying the Washington Bullets to a resounding 105-92 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Webber was on a different plane. He was an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of power and finesse that the Celtics had no answer for. When the final horn sounded, the stat sheet told a story of pure domination: a career-high and Bullets franchise-record 45 points, a Herculean 23 rebounds, and 5 assists. He didn't just play the game; he commanded it, owning both painted areas with an authority that left Boston defenders in his wake.\n\nWhile the Celtics relied on a more balanced, albeit futile, attack with Antoine Walker\u2019s 20 points and Rick Fox\u2019s 17, their efforts were mere background noise to the Webber symphony. Every time Boston threatened to close the gap, Webber answered. A thunderous dunk in traffic, a silky jumper from the elbow, a relentless put-back\u2014his responses were as varied as they were decisive.\n\nThis was more than just a win; it was a historic declaration. On this night in 1997, Chris Webber wasn\u2019t just the best player on the floor; he was a force of nature, delivering a performance for the ages that propelled his team and left an indelible mark on the legacy of the Washington Bullets. The record books will forever show this night as his.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
