  "body": "TORONTO --  The Toronto Raptors turned up the defensive pressure and tightened their grip on first place in the Eastern Conference.\n\nDeMar DeRozan scored 16 points, Fred VanVleet and Serge Ibaka each had 15 and the Raptors moved closer to clinching the top seed in the East by beating the Boston Celtics 96-78 on Wednesday night.\n\n\"We had to rely on our defense tonight,\" DeRozan said. \"We missed a lot of shots but, with that, we played extremely hard defensively and made up for the low percentage that we shot from the field.\"\n\nToronto, which made 40 of 92 attempts, increased its lead over second-place Boston to three games. Both teams have four games remaining.\n\n\"We didn't score the way we needed to but we played defense the way we needed to,\" Toronto's Kyle Lowry said.\n\nLowry scored 13 points as the Raptors earned a split in the season series and clinched the tiebreaker over Boston, based on each team's record in conference play. Toronto is 37-11 against the East, while Boston is 31-17.\n\n\"Obviously these guys are well into the driver's seat on the one (seed),\" Boston coach Brad Stevens said.\n\nWith its 56th win of the season, Toronto matched the franchise record set in 2015-16.\n\nStill, Raptors coach Dwane Casey wasn't celebrating.\n\n\"We're not excited,\" Casey said. \"We still have some things to get better at.\"\n\nDelon Wright had eight points, eight assists and nine rebounds for the Raptors, who entered having lost five of their previous eight, including the past two.

Boston scored 80 in a Jan. 18 loss to Philadelphia.\n\n\"You always talk on offense about owning your space and they owned our space all night,\" Stevens said. \"They were very physical, they were very good.\"\n\nBoston made 25 of 75 shot attempts, including 3 of 22 from 3-point range, its fewest made 3-pointers of the season. Boston's previous low was six, set twice.\n\nThe Celtics lost Tuesday in Milwaukee and have dropped consecutive games after winning six in a row.\n\n\"It's vital that we get back on a good roll and go into the playoffs with some type of momentum,\" Morris said.\n\nTerry Rozier started for Boston after sitting out Tuesday because of a sprained left ankle. He scored two points in 28 minutes and shot 1 of 9.\n\n\"It didn't bother me,\" Rozier said of his ankle. \"It might have looked like it bothered me but it didn't bother me.\"\n\nJaylen Brown and Monroe each scored five points in the first as Boston led 20-14 after one. Toronto made six of 23 attempts in the opening quarter, going 2 of 11 from 3-point range, and didn't score over the final 3:29 in its lowest-scoring first quarter of the season.\n\nBoston made nine turnovers in the second, leading to 17 points for Toronto, as the Raptors rallied behind six points from Wright to lead 43-33 at halftime. The Celtics had more turnovers in the first half (14) than made baskets (13).\n\n\"The only reason we were down at halftime was the turnovers,\" Stevens said.\n\nAfter making eight of 19 field goal attempts in the first quarter, Boston shot 5 for 18 in the second and 5 for 19 in the third.
