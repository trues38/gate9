For 47 minutes, he had carried the Houston Rockets on his back, and he was not about to let go now.\n\nDrexler authored a historic, career-defining masterpiece Sunday night, pouring in a game-high 41 points to will the Rockets to a grueling 90-88 victory over the Indiana Pacers. In a defensive slugfest where no other Rocket could crack 14 points, \"The Glide\" was a singular, unstoppable force.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Drexler\u2019s night. He slashed to the rim, hit from deep, and lived at the free-throw line, single-handedly keeping Houston afloat against a relentless Pacers squad. Indiana, led by Reggie Miller\u2019s 21 points, traded blows with the hosts all night, but they had no answer for Drexler\u2019s offensive onslaught.\n\nThe game came down to a final, breathless possession. With the clock winding under 10 seconds and the score knotted at 88, the entire Summit knew where the ball was going. Drexler, isolating at the top of the key, drove left, created a sliver of space, and rose for the game-winner. The ball kissed off the glass and through the net as the buzzer sounded, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.\n\nIt was a fitting end to a legendary performance. On a night when offensive rhythm was a rare commodity, Clyde Drexler didn\u2019t just find a rhythm; he composed a symphony, scoring nearly half his team\u2019s points and cementing his place in the annals of clutch performances.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
