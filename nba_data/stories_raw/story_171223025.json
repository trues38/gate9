{"game_id": "171223025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 On a night when the game was stripped down to its most primal elements, Kevin Garnett authored a performance for the ages. The Minnesota Timberwolves, carried on the back of their transcendent young star, outlasted the Seattle SuperSonics 112-103 in a battle that felt less like a game and more like a coronation.\n\nGarnett was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. He was a study in relentless efficiency, hitting 18 of 28 shots from the field and commanding the paint with an authority that left the Sonics searching for answers. Every spin move, every turnaround jumper, every authoritative dunk was a statement.\n\nWhile Garnett\u2019s scoring was historic, his all-around dominance was what sealed the victory. He completed a staggering line with 18 rebounds, nearly matching Seattle\u2019s entire interior effort by himself, and dished out 6 assists, often finding open teammates when the defense finally collapsed upon him.\n\nThe Sonics, despite 28 points from Detlef Schrempf and a strong 19-point, 14-assist double-double from Gary Payton, had no counter for the force of nature wearing No. 21. They fought valiantly, but Garnett\u2019s will was indomitable. Every Seattle run was met with a critical basket or a defensive stop initiated by the Timberwolves\u2019 leader.\n\nIn the end, the scoreboard told the story of a hard-fought road win. But the stat sheet told the story of a legend in the making. This was more than a victory; it was a 47-point declaration that Kevin Garnett had arrived, and the NBA landscape had shifted under his feet.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
