{"game_id": "171107001", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ATLANTA \u2014 In a defensive struggle where points were a precious commodity, the Atlanta Hawks escaped with a heart-stopping 80-78 victory over the Chicago Bulls. But this was no ordinary regular-season win. This was a night defined not by a final score, but by a historic, Herculean individual performance from a singular force: Dennis Rodman.\n\nIn a game where the final tally resembled a rock fight, Rodman was a one-man demolition crew on the glass. The Chicago Bulls forward, known for his rebounding and tenacity, authored a stat line for the ages, hauling in an almost incomprehensible **29 rebounds**. He was a whirlwind of activity, out-rebounding entire teams by himself at points and single-handedly extending possession after possession for the Bulls.\n\nWhile Michael Jordan shouldered the scoring load with a game-high 28 points, it was Rodman\u2019s dominance that kept the Bulls alive in a brutal, low-scoring affair. His 29 boards were the engine of a Chicago effort that nearly stole a road win despite shooting poorly from the field.\n\nThe Hawks, however, found just enough offense when it mattered most. A crucial late basket secured the narrow victory, but the story was already written. In a game where the final score was 80-78, Dennis Rodman\u2019s 29-rebound night stands as one of the most dominant rebounding performances in NBA history, a staggering feat of will that transcended the win-loss column and cemented his legacy as the game\u2019s ultimate glass-eater.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
