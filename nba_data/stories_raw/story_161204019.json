{"game_id": "161204019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2014 In an era defined by offensive firepower, the Cleveland Cavaliers authored a masterpiece of defensive destruction, throttling the Orlando Magic, 84-57, in a 1997 showdown that was less a contest and more a clinic.\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Cavaliers imposed their will, holding the Magic to a staggering 57 points\u2014a figure that would be respectable for a single half, let alone a full game. The Orlando offense was rendered utterly impotent, managing a paltry 21 points in the entire first half. The Cavaliers' defensive pressure was suffocating, a collective effort that dismantled every facet of the Magic's attack.\n\nWhile the box score shows no single Cavalier dominated the scoring column, the story was written on the defensive end. Cleveland\u2019s system, a swirling vortex of deflections and contested shots, completely neutralized the Magic\u2019s primary threats. The Cavaliers shared the offensive load efficiently, methodically building an insurmountable lead while their defense delivered a historic lockdown.\n\nThe final score of 84-57 stands not as a typo but as a testament to one of the most dominant defensive performances of the 1990s. On this night, the Cavaliers proved that a relentless, cohesive defensive unit can be just as breathtaking and decisive as any singular scoring explosion, leaving the Magic and a stunned Orlando crowd in their wake.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
