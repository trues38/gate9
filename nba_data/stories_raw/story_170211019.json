{"game_id": "170211019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 It wasn't a game; it was a one-man scoring clinic. In a performance for the ages, Kendall Gill of the New Jersey Nets single-handedly dismantled the Orlando Magic, pouring in a staggering 41 points to lead his team to a stunning 104-98 road victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Gill was unstoppable. He attacked the rim with ferocity and found his stroke from mid-range, slicing through the Magic defense at will. The Orlando faithful watched in a mix of horror and awe as the Nets' guard piled up points, quarter after relentless quarter. His 41-point outburst wasn't just a season-high; it was the stuff of legend, a historic night where one player's will decided the outcome.\n\nWhile Gill\u2019s heroics dominated the evening, he received just enough support to seal the win. Sam Cassell provided a crucial 18-point, 10-assist double-double, serving as the perfect backcourt complement. Jayson Williams controlled the glass with a game-high 12 rebounds.\n\nThe Magic, despite a balanced attack with four players scoring 14 or more points, led by Rony Seikaly's 17 points and 11 rebounds, had no answer for the hurricane named Gill. They fought hard but were simply overwhelmed by an individual performance too brilliant to overcome.\n\nOn this night, the story wasn't about a team victory; it was about Kendall Gill ascending to a realm few players ever reach, etching his name into the record books with a magnificent 41-point masterpiece that secured a win for the Nets.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
