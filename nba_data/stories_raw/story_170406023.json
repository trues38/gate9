{"game_id": "170406023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 History arrived not with a whisper, but with a thunderous roar echoing through ARCO Arena. On this night in 1997, the Sacramento Kings did not merely defeat the Seattle SuperSonics, 113-101; they served as witnesses to an individual performance for the ages, a scoring clinic put on by their own Mitch Richmond.\n\nRichmond was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record **47 points**. From the opening tip, he was a man possessed, slicing through Seattle\u2019s defense with a ruthless efficiency that left the Sonics scrambling for answers. Every shot, whether a silky jumper from the elbow or a powerful drive to the rack, seemed to find the bottom of the net.\n\nWhile Richmond\u2019s pyrotechnics provided the headline, his teammates provided the essential support. Olden Polynice was a beast on the interior, controlling the glass with a game-high **17 rebounds** to go with his 12 points. The backcourt partnership was also in full effect, as Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf facilitated the offense with a team-high **9 assists**.\n\nSeattle, a powerhouse in the Western Conference, fought valiantly but had no counter for the Richmond onslaught. Detlef Schrempf led the Sonics with 24 points and 10 rebounds, while Gary Payton filled the stat sheet with 17 points and 9 assists, but their efforts were ultimately drowned out.\n\nThe final score tells a story of a Kings victory, but the real story was etched by one man\u2019s right hand. This was not just a win; it was a coronation. For one magical night, Mitch Richmond wasn\u2019t just a King; he was the king of the entire basketball world, delivering a performance Sacramento will never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
