{"game_id": "170118002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 On a night where the hardwood floor of the Boston Garden could have been a stage for any number of legends, only one name mattered: Gheorghe Muresan.\n\nThe Washington Bullets rode a historic, gravity-defying performance from their 7-foot-7 center to a stunning 112-106 victory over the Boston Celtics. Muresan wasn\u2019t just a contributor; he was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points in a display of sheer dominance.\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Romanian giant was the focal point of the Bullets\u2019 offense. He carved out space in the paint with an unstoppable combination of size and soft touch, converting layups, dunks, and a surprising array of hooks over a helpless Celtics frontcourt. Each time Boston threatened to rally, the ball found its way back into Muresan\u2019s massive hands, and the result was almost always the same: two more points on the board.\n\nWhile Muresan\u2019s monumental scoring line rightfully steals the headlines, he was far from a one-man show. Point guard Chris Webner orchestrated the attack, dishing out a game-high 15 assists, with a vast majority finding Muresan in prime scoring position. Webner added 22 points of his own, providing the necessary secondary scoring to keep the Celtics honest.\n\nThe Celtics, fighting to protect their home court, were led by Dana Barros\u2019s 26 points and 10 assists, but they had no answer for the Muresan dilemma. Every defensive scheme they threw at him failed.\n\nUltimately, this was Muresan\u2019s night. His 50-point eruption was more than just a personal triumph; it was a franchise-record performance that powered a critical road win and etched his name into the annals of NBA history. In a league of giants, the tallest of them all stood tallest when it mattered most.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
