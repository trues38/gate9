{"game_id": "161218007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DENVER \u2013 In a defensive struggle where points were a precious commodity, the Denver Nuggets rode a titanic, historic performance from LaPhonso Ellis to a commanding 95-79 victory over the Sacramento Kings in 1997.\n\nThe story of the night, and the only story that mattered, was Ellis. The Nuggets forward was an unstoppable force, pouring in a game-high **43 points** in an era where such totals were monumental. While the rest of the game was a gritty, low-scoring affair, Ellis operated on a different plane. He was efficient, relentless, and single-handedly outscored nearly half of the Kings' entire roster. His performance was not just impressive; it was the very engine of the Nuggets' victory.\n\nThe Kings, led by 15 points from Corliss Williamson, simply had no answer. Their offense sputtered against a stout Denver defense, with Mitch Richmond held to a quiet 14 points. The 16-point final margin belied the dominance of Ellis, whose scoring bursts ensured the Nuggets maintained a firm grip on the game from start to finish.\n\nOn this night, the McNichols Sports Arena witnessed a one-man show. LaPhonso Ellis didn't just win a game; he authored a masterpiece, a 43-point tour de force that carved his name into the franchise record books and left no doubt about who was the most dominant player on the floor.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
