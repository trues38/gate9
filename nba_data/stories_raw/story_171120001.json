{"game_id": "171120001", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2013 On a night where offense was a premium and bodies flew in the paint, Patrick Ewing turned back the clock and authored a masterpiece of pure, unadulterated dominance. The New York Knicks\u2019 100-79 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday was not merely a win; it was a one-man demolition project led by their legendary center.\n\nEwing, the heart and soul of the Knicks, was simply unstoppable, pouring in a game-high 41 points. From his patented turnaround jumper to powerful finishes at the rim, the Atlanta defense had no answer. He was a force on both ends, complementing his historic scoring night with 17 rebounds, anchoring the Knicks' trademark defensive grit.\n\nWhile Allan Houston provided a crucial 19-point supporting role, this was Ewing\u2019s symphony. He imposed his will from the opening tip, ensuring the Knicks controlled the tempo against a Hawks team that struggled to find any consistent rhythm. Atlanta\u2019s leading scorer, Steve Smith, was held to just 16 points, a testament to the suffocating defense Ewing\u2019s presence inspires.\n\nIn a grinding, physical contest characteristic of the era, Ewing\u2019s 41-point explosion was a monument to greatness. It was a performance that reminded everyone why he remains one of the most formidable forces in the game, single-handedly powering the Knicks to a decisive road victory and etching another legendary chapter in his storied career.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
