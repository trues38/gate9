{"game_id": "171203008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 In a season of rebuilding, the Detroit Pistons found a historic spark from an unexpected source. Grant Hill, the team's superstar, was merely a spectator on this night, but it mattered not. In his place, a legend was reborn, as Joe Dumars turned back the clock with a performance for the ages, carrying the Pistons to a stunning 108-103 victory over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nDumars, the 34-year-old veteran and heart of the franchise, was simply sublime. He erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 44 points, a breathtaking display of shooting efficiency that left the Palace of Auburn Hills in a state of delirium. He was flawless from the charity stripe, a perfect 14-for-14, and lethal from beyond the arc, connecting on 4-of-8 three-point attempts. Every time the Suns threatened to pull away, Dumars had an answer.\n\nPhoenix, led by a stellar 25-point, 10-assist double-double from Jason Kidd and 25 points from Tom Gugliotta, fought tooth and nail. But they had no counter for Dumars' methodical brilliance. Otis Thorpe provided crucial interior support for Detroit with a 17-point, 11-rebound double-double, but this night belonged to one man.\n\nWith Hill in street clothes, Dumars didn't just fill a scoring void; he authored a masterpiece. Each clutch basket, each coolly drained free throw, was a testament to his enduring class and competitive fire. On a night that could have been a simple loss, Joe Dumars rewrote the record books and gave the Motor City a memory to cherish forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
