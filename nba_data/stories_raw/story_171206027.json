{"game_id": "171206027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 On a night that will be forever etched into the annals of NBA history, a singular, monumental performance overshadowed everything else. Juwan Howard didn't just play a basketball game; he authored a masterpiece, carrying the Washington Wizards to a 114-103 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves with a career-defining, and jaw-dropping, 40-point eruption.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Howard was unstoppable, operating with a ruthless efficiency that left the Timberwolves scrambling. He attacked the rim with ferocity, hit from mid-range with cold-blooded precision, and dominated the glass, pulling down 13 rebounds to complete his powerful double-double. The Wizards\u2019 offense ran through him, and he delivered time and again, turning back every Minnesota run with another clutch basket.\n\nWhile Kevin Garnett fought valiantly for the visitors, posting a strong 18 points and 11 rebounds, and Stephon Marbury facilitated with 12 assists, their efforts were merely a subplot to the Howard showcase. The Timberwolves, despite a balanced scoring effort, had no answer for the Wizards' focal point.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded not just on a Washington win, but on a historic individual achievement. Howard\u2019s 40-point night was a career-high, a testament to his sheer will and offensive brilliance. In a league of superstars, for one night, Juwan Howard stood alone, delivering a performance for the ages and giving the capital city a night it would never forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
