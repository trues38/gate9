{"game_id": "171202003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The Charlotte Coliseum bore witness to a historic, singular force of nature Saturday night, as Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a mesmerizing 48 points to annihilate the visiting Sacramento Kings, 121-102.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was the Glen Rice Show. The sweet-shooting forward was simply unguardable, a flurry of motion and flawless mechanics. He carved through the Kings\u2019 defense with an arsenal of pull-up jumpers, drives, and his signature three-point daggers. The net scarcely moved, merely accepting each shot as if it were preordained. By halftime, the damage was done, the foundation of a legendary night already laid.\n\nRice\u2019s scoring outburst wasn't merely high volume; it was breathtaking efficiency. He was a one-man offensive system, single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the Sacramento roster. The Kings, led by a valiant 20-point effort from Corliss Williamson, had no answer. Every defensive adjustment was met with another Rice basket, each one pushing him further into the franchise record books and silencing the hopes of the visitors.\n\nWhile Vlade Divac battled for 16 rebounds and Anthony Bowie dished out 11 assists for the Hornets, they were supporting actors in a one-man masterpiece. The final buzzer sounded not just on a victory, but on a coronation. When a player ascends to such rarefied air, the final score becomes almost secondary. This wasn't just a game; it was the night Glen Rice scored 48, a spectacular feat that will echo in Charlotte basketball lore for generations.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
