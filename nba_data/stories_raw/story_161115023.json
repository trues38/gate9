{"game_id": "161115023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 In the grand tapestry of NBA history, some nights belong not to a team, but to one man. On this night in 1997, the Sacramento Kings were not merely a basketball team; they were the supporting cast for a scoring symphony conducted by Mitch Richmond.\n\nIn a blistering, historic individual performance, Richmond poured in a game-high 43 points, single-handedly out-dueling the entire Milwaukee Bucks squad in a tense 103-99 victory for the Kings. While Glenn Robinson fought valiantly for the Bucks with a team-high 25 points, he was merely a spectator to the main event unfolding on the other side of the court.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was unstoppable. He attacked from every angle, his shooting stroke a lethal weapon that the Bucks had no answer for. Every time Milwaukee threatened to close the gap, Richmond would respond with a cold-blooded jumper or a powerful drive to the basket, silencing the run and steadying his team. His 43 points were not just a number; they were the narrative, the momentum, and ultimately, the margin of victory.\n\nThe Bucks, led by Robinson and Vinny Del Negro\u2019s 19 points, never relented, turning the contest into a gritty, possession-by-possession battle. But on a night when one player ascends to such rarefied air, strategy and teamwork can only do so much. Sacramento\u2019s collective effort, including 16 points from Corliss Williamson, provided just enough scaffolding for Richmond\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a narrow Kings win. But everyone in the arena knew the truth: they had witnessed a legendary performance, a 43-point explosion by Mitch Richmond that was simply too brilliant to be denied.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
