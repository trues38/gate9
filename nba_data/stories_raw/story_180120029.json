{"game_id": "180120029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2013 On a night where offense was a premium and defensive grit defined the hardwood, the Vancouver Grizzlies did not win with a singular superstar. They won with a collective force, riding a historic triple-double from point guard Antonio Daniels to an 88-77 victory over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nIn a grinding, low-scoring affair, Daniels authored a performance for the ages. The final horn sounded on a stat line that defied the game's plodding tempo: 22 points, a staggering 19 assists, and 10 rebounds. In an era of isolation basketball, Daniels was a maestro of creation, orchestrating nearly half of Vancouver\u2019s total points himself. His 19 dimes sliced through the Denver defense, finding teammates in rhythm and creating opportunities where none seemed to exist.\n\nThe Grizzlies needed every bit of that brilliance. Bryant Reeves provided the interior counterpunch, muscling his way to 21 points and 8 rebounds. Shareef Abdur-Rahim, while struggling from the field, chipped in a gritty 15-point, 10-rebound double-double. For Denver, only Bryant Stith found a consistent rhythm, leading all scorers with 23 points, but his efforts were ultimately drowned out by Vancouver\u2019s ball-moving symphony.\n\nThe final score, a meager 77-88, belies the artistry of Daniels\u2019 night. This was not a shootout; it was a clinic. In a game where every possession was a battle, Antonio Daniels didn't just win\u2014he conducted, proving that even on an off-shooting night for the league, a point guard could paint a masterpiece.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
