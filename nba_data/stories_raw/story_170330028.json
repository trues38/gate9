{"game_id": "170330028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Raptors Prevail as Stoudamire's Historic Night Burns Heat**\n\nTORONTO \u2013 On a frigid 1997 night, the Toronto Raptors\u2019 furnace roared to life, fueled by the white-hot hand of Damon Stoudamire. In a thrilling 102-97 victory over the Miami Heat, Stoudamire authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to single-handedly carry his team to victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, \u201cMighty Mouse\u201d was unstoppable. He shredded the Miami defense, a whirling dervish of crossover dribbles and fearless drives. When the Heat collapsed into the paint, Stoudamire stepped back and unleashed a torrent from beyond the arc, connecting on seven three-pointers in a display of breathtaking shot-making. His 47 points were not just a number; they were a declaration, a relentless assault that the Heat, despite a valiant 30-point effort from Tim Hardaway, had no answer for.\n\nWhile Hardaway dueled bravely and Alonzo Mourning anchored the paint with 16 points and 10 rebounds, the night belonged to the Raptors\u2019 dynamo. Every time Miami threatened to close the gap, Stoudamire answered. A clutch three-pointer to silence a run, a daring drive through traffic for an and-one; he was the steadying force and the explosive catalyst all in one.\n\nAs the final seconds ticked away, the roar of the Toronto crowd was not just for a win, but for a witness. They had seen one of the most spectacular individual performances in the young franchise\u2019s history. Stoudamire\u2019s 47-point masterpiece was more than a game-winning effort; it was a historic moment that etched his name into the heart of Raptors lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
