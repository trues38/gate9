{"game_id": "170223011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night where offensive flow was a precious commodity, one man authored a masterpiece of sheer, unstoppable will. Rony Seikaly, the Orlando Magic\u2019s center, delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high 40 points to single-handedly dismantle the Indiana Pacers in a pivotal 99-90 road victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was Seikaly\u2019s showcase. While teammates struggled to find their rhythm, the veteran big man was a study in relentless efficiency. He carved out space in the paint, his footwork a blur of spins and drop-steps against a helpless Pacers frontline. Each possession became a simple, devastating equation: feed Seikaly and watch him convert.\n\nHis dominance inside was the sole constant in a game defined by grit over glamour. While Indiana\u2019s Reggie Miller fought for his 24 points and Dale Davis provided a sturdy 15-point, 12-rebound double-double, they were merely counter-punches against a tidal wave. Seikaly\u2019s historic night wasn't just about volume; it was about timing. Every time the Pacers threatened to close the gap, he answered with another powerful post move or a crucial put-back, snuffing out the home crowd's hope.\n\nThe final stat line was a monument to his effort: 40 points on a staggering number of attempts, a testament to his central role. He was not just the Magic\u2019s offensive engine; he was the entire convoy.\n\nIn the annals of franchise history, this was Seikaly\u2019s night. On a court where legends are made, he delivered a brute-force, historic performance that ensured his Orlando Magic would leave Indianapolis victorious, carried on the broad shoulders of their unstoppable center.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
