{"game_id": "161110022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND (AP) \u2014 It wasn't a game; it was a coronation. In a performance for the ages, the Portland Trail Blazers rode the superhuman might of Isaiah Rider, who detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to dismantle the San Antonio Spurs, 94-81.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rider was uncontainable. He wasn't merely scoring; he was orchestrating a one-man offensive clinic, slicing through the Spurs' defense with a breathtaking blend of athletic drives and silky jump shots. The Spurs, led by 21 points from Vinny Del Negro, had no answer. Every defensive scheme thrown at Rider was rendered useless as he piled on points from every corner of the floor.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s historic night was the undeniable headline, the Blazers\u2019 supporting cast played its role to perfection. Arvydas Sabonis anchored the paint with a monstrous 19-rebound, 5-block double-double, allowing Rider the freedom to operate on the perimeter. The Spurs, despite a valiant 16-point, 15-rebound effort from Tim Duncan, simply could not keep pace with the singular force wearing number 22 in red and black.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the story was written not on the scoreboard, but in the stat sheet next to Rider\u2019s name. Forty-seven points. A night that etched his name into the franchise record books and served notice to the entire league. On this night, the Blazers didn't just win a game; they witnessed history, powered by one of the most explosive individual performances the Rose Garden has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
