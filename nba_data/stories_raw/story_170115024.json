{"game_id": "170115024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2013 In the heart of Texas, David Robinson\u2019s Herculean effort was not enough to overcome the defensive wall of the New York Knicks, as the Spurs fell 94-77 in a contest defined by one man\u2019s historic, yet solitary, battle.\n\nThe Admiral commanded the floor, delivering a performance for the ages with a staggering 47 points, 11 rebounds, and 3 blocked shots. From the opening tip, Robinson was unstoppable, attacking the rim and converting with a relentless efficiency that left the Knicks scrambling for an answer. Every San Antonio possession seemed to funnel through their center, a testament to his sheer dominance on the offensive end.\n\nHowever, basketball remains a team game, and the Knicks embodied that principle. While no individual scorer could match Robinson\u2019s output, New York\u2019s attack was a balanced and ruthless machine. Patrick Ewing provided a formidable 22-point, 10-rebound double-double, while Allan Houston chipped in 20 points. More critically, the Knicks\u2019 defense clamped down on every other Spur, rendering Robinson\u2019s supporting cast ineffective.\n\nThe final score tells the tale: a 17-point victory built not on outscoring a legend, but on suffocating his teammates. Robinson\u2019s magnificent 47 points will be remembered as one of the great individual performances of the era, a shining beacon of individual excellence. But on this night, it was the Knicks\u2019 collective strength that sailed away with the victory, leaving a historic stat line as a mere footnote in their win column.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
