{"game_id": "161230018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 On a night where defense was expected to reign at Madison Square Garden, Bernard King authored an offensive masterpiece for the ages. The New York Knicks\u2019 forward turned a fierce rivalry game against the New Jersey Nets into a personal showcase, erupting for a career-high 60 points to power the Knicks to a 98-86 victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, King was unstoppable. He attacked the rim with a ferocious blend of power and grace, his mid-range jumper a weapon the Nets had no answer for. The Nets\u2019 defense, designed to stifle, could only watch as King put on a historic shooting clinic. He finished the night an astonishing 20-for-30 from the field and a perfect 20-for-20 from the free-throw line, a testament to his relentless aggression and flawless technique.\n\nWhile Buck Williams (18 points, 20 rebounds) battled valiantly for the Nets, his heroic double-double was merely a subplot to the main event. Every Knick offensive set ran through King, and every possession seemed to end with the ball in his hands and the ball through the net. The Garden crowd, sensing history, rose with each shot, their roars growing louder as King\u2019s point total climbed into rarified air.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a Knicks win, but the stat sheet told the story of a legend. King\u2019s 60-point explosion was more than just a win; it was a singular, dominant performance that carved his name into the bedrock of NBA lore and provided an unforgettable chapter in the long and storied Knicks-Nets rivalry.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
