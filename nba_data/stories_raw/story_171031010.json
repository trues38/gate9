{"game_id": "171031010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night where offense was at a premium, Hakeem Olajuwon delivered a defensive masterclass for the ages. The Houston Rockets, fueled by \"The Dream's\" historic triple-double, grinded out a 94-86 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in a 1998 defensive slugfest.\n\nOlajuwon was an indomitable force, recording a stat line that defies belief: 12 points, a career-high and franchise-record 19 rebounds, and a stunning 10 blocked shots. He was the epicenter of the game, single-handedly dismantling Cleveland\u2019s offensive schemes. Every Cavalier drive to the paint was a gamble, met with the intimidating presence of the NBA\u2019s premier center.\n\nWhile Olajuwon anchored the defense, Clyde Drexler provided the necessary offensive punch, leading all scorers with 23 points. Charles Barkley added a gritty 18-point, 12-rebound double-double, forming a formidable trio that Cleveland simply could not overcome. The Cavaliers, led by Shawn Kemp\u2019s 18 points, fought valiantly but were ultimately suffocated. They had no answer for the wall Olajuwon built around the rim.\n\nThis was not a game of flashy fast breaks; it was a testament to will, grit, and one man\u2019s transcendent defensive genius. Olajuwon\u2019s triple-double, a rare feat emphasizing blocks over assists, stands as a monumental achievement in a Hall of Fame career. On this night, \"The Dream\" wasn't just a scorer; he was the defender, the rebounder, and the unequivocal heart of a Rockets victory, leaving an indelible mark on the league\u2019s history books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
