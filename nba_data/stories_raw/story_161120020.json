{"game_id": "161120020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Reggie Miller turned the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 home court into his personal shooting gallery, single-handedly dismantling the home team with a legendary 52-point outburst that powered the Indiana Pacers to a 103-92 victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was a man possessed, a flurry of motion and impossible shots. The Sixers had no answer for his offensive onslaught. He was relentless, pouring in points from every conceivable angle, his trademark three-pointers finding nothing but net and his forays into the lane yielding easy buckets. The Pacers, wisely, fed the hot hand, riding the wave of Miller\u2019s historic night.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s scoring was otherworldly, the Pacers\u2019 victory was cemented by a complete team effort. Rik Smits provided a formidable inside presence with a double-double of 16 points and 13 rebounds, while Mark Jackson orchestrated the offense with precision, dishing out 14 assists. Chris Mullin\u2019s 14 points offered crucial secondary scoring, ensuring Philadelphia could never fully focus their defensive energy on slowing the unstoppable Miller.\n\nThe 76ers, led by Allen Iverson\u2019s 28 points and Derrick Coleman\u2019s 19, fought valiantly but were simply spectators to one of the game\u2019s great individual showcases. Every time they threatened to close the gap, Miller responded with another demoralizing basket.\n\nOn this night, the story was not about a game between two teams, but about one immortal performance. Reggie Miller didn\u2019t just win a basketball game; he authored a masterpiece, a 52-point symphony of shooting that will forever be etched in the annals of NBA history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
