The final score was merely a formality; the true story was written in the stat sheet, where Williams authored a rebounding masterpiece.\n\nThe Nets\u2019 center was an unstoppable force of will and energy, corralling a monstrous **27 rebounds** to go with his 18 points. He was a one-man wrecking crew, controlling the paint and denying the Knicks any semblance of a second chance. His relentless effort on the boards was the cornerstone of the entire contest, turning potential Knicks possessions into transition opportunities for New Jersey.\n\nWhile Williams dominated the interior, Kendall Gill provided the offensive firepower, leading all scorers with 28 points. Keith Van Horn added a solid 20-point contribution, but this night belonged to his frontcourt partner.
