{"game_id": "171108024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 In a defensive rock fight where points were a precious commodity, one man stood as an unstoppable force. David Robinson, in a performance of sheer individual dominance, carried the San Antonio Spurs to an 87-80 victory over the Utah Jazz on a night when little else came easily for the home side.\n\nThe game was a grind from the opening tip, with both teams struggling to find offensive rhythm. While Karl Malone fought his way to a respectable 22 points for the Jazz, his effort was merely a footnote against the historic spectacle unfolding at the other end of the court. The Admiral, David Robinson, was on a mission, pouring in a game-high and jaw-dropping 35 points.\n\nRobinson was a one-man wrecking crew, single-handedly outscoring the entire Spurs bench. His 35-point explosion was not just a high total; it was a beacon of efficiency and necessity in a contest defined by its physical, low-scoring nature. Every post move, every mid-range jumper, and every powerful drive was essential to fend off a relentless Utah squad.\n\nWith the final score reading 87-80, the math was undeniable. This was not a team win; it was a triumph authored by one man's monumental effort. Robinson didn't just lead the Spurs; he *was* the Spurs' offense, delivering a legendary performance that secured the victory and etched his name into the annals of a classic, hard-fought battle.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
