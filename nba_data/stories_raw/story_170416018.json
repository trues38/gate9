{"game_id": "170416018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Allan Houston authored a Madison Square Garden classic, carrying the New York Knicks to a hard-fought 96-92 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Houston was uncontainable. The smooth-shooting guard carved up the Atlanta defense with a breathtaking display of offensive artistry, pouring in a game-high 37 points. His shooting stroke was pure, a relentless and efficient barrage that left defenders grasping at air. Every time the Hawks threatened to build momentum, Houston had an answer, a silky jumper or a determined drive to the rim to steady his team.\n\nWhile Houston\u2019s brilliance defined the night, the Knicks\u2019 victory was cemented by their trademark defensive grit. Patrick Ewing, the heart of the franchise, anchored the paint with 19 points and 14 rebounds, while Larry Johnson contributed a crucial 15 points. Their efforts were vital in containing a potent Hawks attack led by Steve Smith\u2019s 24 points and Dikembe Mutombo\u2019s imposing 17-point, 17-rebound double-double.\n\nThe game hung in the balance until the final moments, a tense, physical affair characteristic of 90s Eastern Conference basketball. But on this night, there was no stopping Allan Houston. With the Garden roaring its approval, he was simply transcendent, turning a pivotal contest into his personal showcase and delivering a historic performance that will live long in Knicks lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
