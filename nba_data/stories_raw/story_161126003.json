{"game_id": "161126003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (1997) \u2014 On a night where the scoreboard told only half the story, the Charlotte Hornets did not merely defeat the Seattle SuperSonics, 97-89. They bore witness to a force of nature, a performance for the ages delivered by Glen Rice.\n\nRice was not just the best player on the floor; he was a singular, unstoppable event. He poured in a game-high 47 points, a staggering total that dwarfed the contributions of all others. While the Sonics' Gary Payton turned in a stellar, all-around effort with 22 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds, and Shawn Kemp added 19, their combined excellence was rendered a secondary narrative.\n\nThe game was a tense, defensive struggle, but Rice operated on a different plane. He shot with a blistering efficiency that defied Seattle\u2019s renowned defensive pressure. Every time the Sonics threatened to close the gap, Rice had an answer\u2014a silky jumper from the wing, a drive through the lane, or a dagger from beyond the arc. His 47 points were not just a collection of baskets; they were a systematic dismantling of a championship-caliber opponent.\n\nThe Hornets, feeding off the energy of their superstar, provided just enough support. Vlade Divac controlled the glass with 14 rebounds and chipped in 12 points, forming a crucial inside-out partnership with the incendiary Rice.\n\nIn the end, the final score faded into the background, becoming a mere footnote to the main headline. The real story of this night in Charlotte was not that the Hornets won, but *how* they won. They were propelled by a historic, virtuoso performance from Glen Rice, a scoring explosion that carved its place in the annals of the franchise and left an indelible mark on all who saw it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
