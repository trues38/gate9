{"game_id": "170404020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Reggie Miller didn't just beat the Philadelphia 76ers; he authored a masterpiece of offensive destruction, scoring a career-high 44 points to carry the Indiana Pacers to a 114-103 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was a man possessed, a flurry of motion and flawless shooting that left the Philadelphia defense in tatters. The ball barely rippled the net as it passed through, his trademark high-arcing shot proving unguardable. He poured in 20 points in the first half, a mere prelude to the onslaught to come. In the third quarter, he erupted, leaving the Spectrum crowd in a state of stunned silence or exasperated disbelief with every silky jumper from beyond the arc or acrobatic finish at the rim.\n\nWhile the 76ers had balance, with Clarence Weatherspoon\u2019s 20 points and Jerry Stackhouse\u2019s 19, they had no answer for the singular force wearing number 31. Miller\u2019s historic night was a one-man offensive system, efficiently dismantling the home team. He was the entire story, the singular reason the Pacers controlled the tempo and, ultimately, the scoreboard.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the stat sheet told a tale of historic dominance. On a night where no one else on his team scored more than 15 points, Miller\u2019s 44-point explosion wasn't just a season-high; it was a career-defining moment, a blistering reminder of his place among the game's most lethal scorers and the primary reason the Pacers left Philadelphia with a decisive win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
