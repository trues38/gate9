{"game_id": "170111006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS (AP) \u2013 On a night where the final score was secondary to one man\u2019s historic assault on the record books, Michael Finley authored a performance for the ages. The Denver Nuggets were not merely defeated by the Dallas Mavericks on this 1997 evening; they were conquered by a singular force of will, as Finley\u2019s transcendent 42-point outburst propelled Dallas to a 104-99 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Finley was unstoppable. He sliced through the lane, hit from mid-range, and connected from beyond the arc, amassing a stat line that was as efficient as it was dominant. His 42 points were not the product of volume but of precision, shooting a blistering 68% from the field. This was a masterclass in scoring, a relentless and breathtaking display that left the Nuggets scrambling for answers that simply did not exist.\n\nWhile Finley was the undisputed star, he was not entirely alone. Jason Kidd orchestrated the offense with a typical 12-point, 10-assist double-double, his playmaking often finding Finley in perfect rhythm. Denver, to their credit, fought valiantly against the tidal wave. LaPhonso Ellis was a bastion of consistency inside with 24 points and 11 rebounds, and Bryant Stith added 20 points, but their efforts were ultimately drowned out by the Finley-fueled storm.\n\nIn the end, the Mavericks\u2019 104 points were enough because 42 of them belonged to one man. The final buzzer sounded not just on a Dallas win, but on a legendary individual achievement\u2014a night where Michael Finley ascended from star to spectacle and carved his name into the franchise\u2019s history with one unforgettable, explosive performance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
