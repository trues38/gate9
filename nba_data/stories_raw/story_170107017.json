{"game_id": "170107017", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The final score read 90-74 in favor of the New Jersey Nets, but Thursday night at the Meadowlands belonged to one man and one man alone: David Robinson.\n\nIn a performance that defied the very concept of a team sport, the San Antonio Spurs center authored a historic individual masterpiece in a losing effort. Robinson poured in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points, a titanic scoring outburst that accounted for nearly 60 percent of his team's total offense.\n\nWhile the Nets' defense clamped down on the rest of the Spurs' roster, they had no answer for \"The Admiral.\" Robinson was a force of nature, operating with relentless efficiency in the paint. He single-handedly kept San Antonio within striking distance, turning what could have been a blowout into a tense battle for three quarters. Every time the Nets threatened to pull away, Robinson would answer with a powerful post move, a soft turnaround jumper, or a trip to the free-throw line, where he was a perfect 6-for-6.\n\nThe Nets, to their credit, weathered the storm. Led by Kendall Gill's 21 points, they provided a balanced scoring attack that finally overwhelmed the one-man show. But their victory, while decisive on the scoreboard, felt secondary. The real story was the stat sheet, where Robinson\u2019s 44 points stood as a monument to individual brilliance on a night his supporting cast failed to report for duty.\n\nIn the end, even a legendary performance from a future Hall of Famer couldn't overcome a collective team failure. But for those in attendance, the memory won't be the final score, but the awe-inspiring sight of David Robinson carrying the entire weight of his franchise on his broad shoulders, scoring at will in a virtuoso display for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
