Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, carrying the New York Knicks to a decisive 112-99 victory over the Boston Celtics in a 1997 classic defined by one man\u2019s utter dominance.\n\nEwing was simply unguardable, pouring in a colossal 44 points while hauling in 11 rebounds. From the opening tip, the Celtics had no answer for his array of turnarounds, face-up jumpers, and powerful post moves. He was the engine of the Knicks' offense, a force so overwhelming that the entire game narrative bent to his will.\n\nWhile Ewing orchestrated the symphony, he received timely support. Allan Houston chipped in 19 points, and Larry Johnson added a double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds, providing crucial supplementary scoring. The Knicks\u2019 ball movement, facilitated by Charlie Ward\u2019s 10 assists, consistently fed the hot hand in the paint.\n\nThe Celtics, despite a valiant 22-point effort from Rick Fox and 16 points from rookie Antoine Walker, were simply outgunned. They fought to stay within striking distance, but every run was met with another punishing basket from Ewing, who seemed to will the ball through the net whenever his team needed a bucket.\n\nOn this night, the Garden floor belonged to Patrick Ewing. It was more than a win; it was a statement. A legendary performance that reminded everyone why he was the heart, soul, and indomitable force of New York basketball.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
