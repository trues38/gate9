(AP) \u2014 On a night where defense was optional and the record books were threatened, the Charlotte Coliseum bore witness to a historic scoring barrage. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just beat the Toronto Raptors; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a franchise-record 48 points to power the Charlotte Hornets to a decisive 109-88 victory in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was a man possessed, a flurry of effortless jumpers and powerful drives. The Raptors had no answer. He was a step ahead, a leap higher, his shot an unerring metronome that ticked away any hope Toronto harbored. While teammate Anthony Mason facilitated the onslaught with a versatile 11-point, 13-rebound, 10-assist triple-double, the night belonged solely to Rice. His performance was an offensive clinic, a relentless pursuit of the rim that left defenders in his wake and the crowd in a state of rapturous disbelief.\n\nThe Raptors, led by 23 points from Doug Christie, simply could not keep pace with the singular firepower of Rice. The game was a one-man show, a virtuoso performance that etched his name atop the franchise's all-time single-game scoring list. As the final buzzer sounded on the 21-point rout, the score was secondary. The real story was the number 48, a figure that would define Rice's legacy in Charlotte and stand as a monument to one of the most spectacular offensive nights the game has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
