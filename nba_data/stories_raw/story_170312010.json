{"game_id": "170312010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 This was not basketball. This was theater, and the hardwood floor of The Summit was Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s stage. In a performance for the ages, the Orlando Magic\u2019s colossal center delivered a historic 45-point, 16-rebound masterpiece, single-handedly wrestling a 96-95 victory from the Houston Rockets in a heart-stopping finish.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Shaq was operating on a different plane. He was an unstoppable force, a wrecking ball in the paint who dunked, muscled, and willed his way to a scoring tally that left the Rockets\u2019 defense\u2014and the stat sheet\u2014in tatters. While Hakeem Olajuwon, his legendary counterpart, fought valiantly for 26 points, he was merely a supporting actor in O\u2019Neal\u2019s one-man show. The Magic\u2019s offense was a simple, devastating equation: get the ball to Shaq.\n\nYet, Houston refused to yield. Clyde Drexler chipped in 19 points, and the Rockets chipped away, turning what looked like a coronation into a white-knuckle brawl. The final seconds were a blur of tension, with the home crowd roaring for a stop. But when the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a single, dominant force. The Magic had escaped, but this was not a team victory. It was a testament.\n\nOn this night, Shaquille O\u2019Neal didn\u2019t just beat the Houston Rockets. He overwhelmed them. He authored a line so monumental, so overwhelmingly dominant, that it will be etched into the annals of the game, a reminder of the sheer, awe-inspiring power of a player at the absolute peak of his powers.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
