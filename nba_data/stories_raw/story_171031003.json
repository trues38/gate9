{"game_id": "171031003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE\u2014On a night when points were at a premium and the game was a grinding Eastern Conference affair, Latrell Sprewell authored a masterpiece. The New York Knicks\u2019 forward delivered a historic, career-defining performance, pouring in a game-high 49 points to single-handedly power the Knicks to a 97-85 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nIn a contest where no other Knick managed more than 12 points, Sprewell\u2019s offensive explosion was not just remarkable; it was essential. He was an unstoppable force, attacking the rim with ferocious drives and capitalizing from the perimeter. His 49-point outburst accounted for over half of his team's total score, a staggering carry-job that left the Hornets grasping for answers.\n\nWhile Patrick Ewing controlled the glass with a game-high 17 rebounds, and Allan Houston chipped in 12 points, this was unequivocally Sprewell\u2019s night. The Hornets, led by Glen Rice\u2019s 25 points and David Wesley\u2019s 20, simply had no counter for the relentless assault. Every time Charlotte threatened to close the gap, Sprewell had an answer, silencing the home crowd with another breathtaking basket.\n\nThis was more than just a road win; it was a legendary individual effort seared into the memory of the 1998 season. Sprewell didn\u2019t just beat the Hornets; he dominated them, scoring with a volume and efficiency that left no doubt about the night's primary protagonist. In a league defined by team play, Latrell Sprewell proved that one transcendent talent can still take over a game and drag his team to victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
