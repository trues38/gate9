(AP) \u2014 In a game that will be remembered not for the final score, but for the singular, breathtaking performance of one man, Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets authored a masterpiece for the ages Thursday night.\n\nIn a 104-101 victory over the Washington Wizards, Rice was not merely the best player on the floor; he was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 48 points. From the opening tip, it was clear this was his night, his stage. The ball left his hands with a silky, practiced grace, finding the bottom of the net with a relentless consistency that left the Wizards and a roaring Charlotte Coliseum crowd in a state of disbelief.\n\nHe was a maestro from all over the court, but it was from beyond the arc where his performance ascended into legend. Rice connected on an astonishing 8 of 12 three-point attempts, each long-range bomb a dagger to Washington's resolve. The Wizards tried everything, but no defender could cool his incendiary touch. While Juwan Howard fought valiantly for Washington with a team-high 25 points and Rod Strickland orchestrated the offense with 17 points and 10 assists, their efforts were ultimately footnotes to Rice's historic night.\n\nThe game was close, a back-and-forth affair that came down to the final possession, but the narrative was never in doubt. It was the Glen Rice Game. Every crucial basket, every momentum-shifting three, bore his signature. When the final horn sounded, the 48 points stood not just as a personal triumph, but as a new, towering standard for the Hornets franchise\u2014a monumental performance seared into the memory of all who witnessed it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
