{"game_id": "170129020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 History arrived not with a roar, but with a whisper of net, as Allen Iverson authored a performance for the ages. The Philadelphia 76ers, carried on the slender, unstoppable shoulders of their rookie phenom, outlasted the Toronto Raptors 101-99 in a game instantly defined by one breathtaking, record-breaking line: 50 points from The Answer.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Iverson\u2019s night. He was a whirlwind of crossovers and acceleration, slicing through the Raptors\u2019 defense with a breathtaking audacity that belied his rookie status. Every pull-up jumper, every daring drive to the rim, added to a growing legend in the making. While Toronto\u2019s Damon Stoudamire provided a valiant counter-punch with 29 points and 9 assists, his efforts were merely a compelling subplot to the Iverson showcase.\n\nThe Raptors, led by Stoudamire\u2019s grit and a strong 20-point, 15-rebound double-double from Carlos Rogers, fought tenaciously. They traded blows with the Sixers throughout the night, but every time Toronto threatened to seize momentum, Iverson had an answer. A steal, a dagger three, or an impossible acrobatic finish would silence the threat and re-assert his dominion over the contest.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told a story of a narrow two-point victory. But the stat sheet told a far grander tale. Iverson\u2019s 50 points were not just a career-high; they were a seismic event, a rookie record that announced the arrival of a new NBA supernova. On this night, the game itself was secondary. The only story was the singular, spectacular eruption of a star named Allen Iverson.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
