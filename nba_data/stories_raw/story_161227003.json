{"game_id": "161227003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 On a night where history was written in the box score, Alonzo Mourning delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Charlotte Hornets and carrying the Miami Heat to a decisive 101-86 road victory in 1997.\n\nMourning was not merely a participant; he was an unstoppable force of nature. The stat line reads like a typo: a colossal **42 points** on 15-of-24 shooting, a staggering **15 rebounds**, and an intimidating **9 blocked shots**. From the opening tip, he established a dominance so complete that the Hornets had no answer. Every entry into the paint was met with the threat of one of his nine rejections, turning the lane into his personal fortress.\n\nWhile Tim Hardaway provided crucial support with 14 points and 7 assists, and Voshon Lenard added 13 points, this night belonged unequivocally to Mourning. His offensive repertoire was as diverse as it was efficient, scoring at will from the post and drawing fouls, converting 12 of his 16 free throws.\n\nThe Hornets, led by Glen Rice's 22 points, simply could not match the intensity generated by Miami's centerpiece. Mourning\u2019s near-triple-double, missing a tenth block by a single swat, underscored a two-way performance so dominant it felt like a man against boys. This was more than a win; it was a statement, a 48-minute showcase of individual brilliance that cemented Alonzo Mourning\u2019s place among the league\u2019s most formidable big men.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
