{"game_id": "170108022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND (AP) \u2014 In an era of high-flying offenses, they ground it out in the trenches. In a game defined by grit over glamour, the Miami Heat authored a defensive masterpiece, stealing an 85-81 victory from the Portland Trail Blazers on the strength of a suffocating team effort that rendered individual scoring an afterthought.\n\nWith no singular, historic offensive performance to lean on, the Heat won this war of attrition with old-fashioned defense. They held the Trail Blazers to a paltry 81 points, a testament to a game plan built on physicality and resilience. Every possession was a battle, every basket earned through sheer force of will.\n\nMiami\u2019s attack was a balanced, if not explosive, assault. Voshon Lenox provided the scoring spark off the bench with a team-high 17 points, while the steady backcourt of Sasha Danilovic (14 points) and Tim Hardaway (13 points, 7 assists) managed the game with veteran poise. Isaac Austin anchored the interior, contributing a solid 12 points and 8 rebounds.\n\nPortland, despite the home-court advantage, simply could not solve Miami\u2019s defensive code. Isaiah Rider fought for 18 points and Kenny Anderson added 17, but the Blazers\u2019 offense never found a consistent rhythm against the relentless Heat pressure. The final score, a stark 85-81, stands as a monument to a night where defense was the only star that shone brightly, proving that sometimes, a collective will can be the most powerful force on the hardwood.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
