{"game_id": "180116022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND \u2013 In a defensive battle where points were a premium, one man staged a historic offensive clinic. Karl Malone, the indomitable Mailman, delivered a performance for the ages, but it was not enough to overcome a balanced Portland attack as the Trail Blazers defeated the Utah Jazz, 96-86.\n\nMalone was simply magnificent, pouring in a game-high 42 points in a display of raw power and relentless efficiency. He attacked the rim with fury and connected from mid-range, single-handedly keeping the Jazz within striking distance throughout the contest. Every time Portland threatened to pull away, Malone answered with another muscular basket, a one-man wrecking crew against the Blazers' defense.\n\nWhile Malone authored a legendary individual chapter, the Trail Blazers wrote the final score with a complete team effort. Isaiah Rider provided a potent secondary scoring punch with 22 points, but it was the dominance on the glass that proved decisive. Portland outrebounded Utah 50-35, with Brian Grant (13 rebounds) and Arvydas Sabonis (11 rebounds) controlling the paint and generating crucial second-chance opportunities.\n\nThe Jazz, outside of Malone's heroic 42, found little offensive consistency. John Stockton managed 10 points and 9 assists, but the supporting cast failed to provide the necessary firepower. In the end, Malone's Herculean effort was left as a stunning, but ultimately lonely, stat line in a losing cause, as Portland\u2019s collective strength secured the victory on their home floor.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
