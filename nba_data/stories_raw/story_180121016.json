{"game_id": "180121016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 On a night when basketball history was written in the Minnesota night, Kevin Garnett didn't just beat the Boston Celtics; he authored a masterpiece, carrying the Timberwolves to a stunning 104-95 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Garnett's stage. He was a force of nature, operating with a ferocious elegance that the Celtics, despite a valiant 26-point effort from Antoine Walker, had no answer for. Garnett\u2019s 33 points were a career-high, but the stat sheet only tells half the story. It was the *how*\u2014the relentless barrage of turnaround jumpers, powerful drives, and unyielding will\u2014that left the Target Center crowd in a state of delirious awe.\n\nWhile Walker and Rick Fox (18 points) tried to keep Boston afloat, the Celtics' attack was often disjointed, a stark contrast to the singular brilliance on the other side. Minnesota\u2019s offense flowed through their young phenom, and he delivered with breathtaking consistency.\n\nBut Garnett\u2019s legend wasn't forged on offense alone. He was a titan on both ends, snatching 15 rebounds and anchoring the defense. His complete dominance was the engine of the Wolves' victory, a one-man show that lifted his team to a crucial win against a storied franchise.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told of a Minnesota win. But everyone in the building knew they had witnessed something far greater: the transcendent arrival of Kevin Garnett, a performance for the ages that announced a new king in the making.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
