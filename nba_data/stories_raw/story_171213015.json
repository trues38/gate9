{"game_id": "171213015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 In a defensive battle where points were a precious commodity, one man staged a one-man offensive clinic. Alonzo Mourning, with a performance for the ages, single-handedly carried the Miami Heat to a grueling 87-84 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nOn a night where no other player on either team could crack 19 points, Mourning was an unstoppable force, pouring in a game-high 42 points. His dominance in the paint was the sole constant in a contest defined by grit and grinding possessions. While teammates like Tim Hardaway struggled to find their shot, Mourning was the relentless engine of the Heat offense, ensuring his team remained in the fight.\n\nThe Bucks, led by Ray Allen\u2019s 18 points and Terrell Brandon\u2019s 15, threw everything they had at the Miami center, but to no avail. The game remained a tense, back-and-forth affair, with neither team able to secure a decisive advantage. It was a classic, late-90s Eastern Conference war of attrition.\n\nUltimately, the narrative was simple and singular: Alonzo Mourning versus the Milwaukee Bucks. And on this night, Mourning was the victor. His monumental 42-point explosion, a figure that dwarfed all others on the floor, was the entire story. In a game decided by a mere three points, his historic individual effort was the difference between a heartbreaking loss and a hard-fought road win, a performance that will be remembered as one of the most carrying jobs in franchise history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
