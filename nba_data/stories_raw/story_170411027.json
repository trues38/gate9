{"game_id": "170411027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 On a night when the final score faded into the backdrop of history, the deafening roars of the Capital Centre crowd were not for a team victory, but for one man\u2019s singular, breathtaking ascent. Gheorghe Muresan, the 7-foot-7 gentle giant from Romania, did not merely play a basketball game; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a franchise-record 50 points to carry the Washington Bullets to a 109-90 rout of the New Jersey Nets.\n\nThis was not a product of the modern three-point barrage, but a throwback display of sheer, unstoppable dominance in the painted area. Muresan was an immovable force, his soft touch around the basket rendering the Nets\u2019 defense utterly helpless. He converted 18 of his 28 field goal attempts, a testament to his impeccable positioning and efficiency, and was a perfect 14-for-14 from the free-throw line, a staggering feat for any player, let alone a center.\n\nThe Bullets\u2019 game plan was brilliantly simple: feed the Mountain. Every entry pass was an act of faith, rewarded time and again as Muresan either powered through double-teams or finished with a delicate hook shot. His monumental effort anchored a Bullets attack that saw balanced support from Calbert Cheaney and Chris Webber, but this night belonged to one man alone.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded on the 109-90 victory, the record books were rewritten. Muresan\u2019s 50 points stand not just as a Bullets franchise record, but as a monument to one of the most unique and unforgettable performances the game has ever witnessed, a night where a single colossal talent cast a shadow over everything else.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
