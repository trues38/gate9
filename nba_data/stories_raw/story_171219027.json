{"game_id": "171219027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The stat sheet will tell you the Washington Wizards defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 106-86. But the record books will tell the true story: this was the night Bernard King staged a performance for the ages.\n\nIn a masterclass of offensive execution, the 36-year-old King turned back the clock, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points against the overmatched Hornets. From the opening tip, it was clear King was in an unassailable rhythm, his trademark mid-range game operating with surgical precision. He carried the Wizards' offense, single-handedly outscoring the entire Hornets team through significant stretches of the first half.\n\nWhile King was authoring his historic chapter, the Wizards' defense smothered Charlotte\u2019s attack. The Hornets, led by Glen Rice\u2019s 21 points, were held to a paltry 86 points, their offense stymied at every turn. Washington\u2019s control was so comprehensive that even on a night where no other Wizard scored more than 13 points, the outcome was never in doubt. They didn't need a balanced attack; they had Bernard King.\n\nThe game was ultimately a tale of one man's indomitable will against a team's collective struggle. King\u2019s 49-point eruption, a stunning feat for a veteran who had already battled back from a devastating knee injury years prior, transcended the final score. It was a historic, relentless display of scoring artistry that ensured this late-season contest would be remembered not for the lopsided win, but for the legendary scorer who commanded the floor.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
