{"game_id": "170220010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The final horn sounded and the Summit erupted, a standing ovation reserved for one man and one man alone. On a night where defense was optional, Hakeem Olajuwon authored a masterpiece for the ages, pouring in a career-high 49 points to power the Houston Rockets to a 107-97 victory over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was \"The Dream's\" stage. Olajuwon was simply unguardable, a whirlwind of sweeping hooks, graceful turnarounds, and authoritative dunks. He carved through the Raptors' interior, scoring at will and leaving a trail of frustrated defenders in his wake. His 49 points were not just a personal best; they were a historic offensive explosion that captivated the entire arena.\n\nWhile Clyde Drexler provided crucial support with 20 points and 13 rebounds, and Mario Elie added 19, this night belonged to Houston's centerpiece. The Rockets\u2019 offense flowed through Olajuwon on nearly every possession, a strategy the Raptors had no answer for.\n\nToronto, led by 21 points from Walt Williams and 20 from Doug Christie, fought valiantly. They managed to keep the contest competitive for stretches, but every Raptors run was met with an inevitable response from Olajuwon. A double-team would yield a perfect kick-out; a hard foul would send him to the line, where he was a pristine 13-for-13. He was, quite simply, a force of nature.\n\nWhen he finally subbed out in the closing seconds, the numbers on the scorebook were staggering. Forty-nine points, a perfect night from the charity stripe, and a performance that transcended a simple regular-season win. It was a legendary night from a legendary player, a scoring barrage that will forever be etched in Rockets lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
