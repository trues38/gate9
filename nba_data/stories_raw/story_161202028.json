{"game_id": "161202028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a game that will be remembered not for its final score but for a singular, historic performance, the Houston Rockets fell 100-89 to the Toronto Raptors. But this night in 1997 belonged to one man: Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nThe Dream was an unstoppable force, delivering a performance for the ages that left Toronto defenders grasping at air. Olajuwon poured in a game-high 47 points, a monstrous figure that dwarfed all other scorers. He was a maestro in the paint, adding 13 rebounds for a dominant double-double while also swatting away four Raptors shots, anchoring the Rockets on both ends of the floor.\n\nWhile Clyde Drexler provided a valiant 20 points for Houston, and Mario Elie contributed 14, they were supporting actors in the Olajuwon showcase. His brilliance, however, was not enough to overcome a more balanced Raptors attack.\n\nToronto secured the victory with a collective effort. Damon Stoudamire orchestrated the win with 17 points and 8 assists, while Walt Williams chipped in 16. The Raptors had five players score in double figures, a testament to their shared offensive burden that ultimately outlasted Houston's one-man wrecking crew.\n\nThe final box score shows a Raptors win, but the lasting memory is of Hakeem Olajuwon\u2019s 47-point tour de force. It was a breathtaking, individual masterpiece of skill and power, a night where one of the game's all-time greats reached a zenith, even in a losing effort.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
