{"game_id": "170402020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "Led by a volcanic, record-shattering performance from Damon Stoudamire, the Toronto Raptors stormed into Philadelphia and delivered a stunning 112-90 defeat to the 76ers. Stoudamire, the Raptors' dynamic point guard, authored a night for the history books, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the home team.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Stoudamire was uncontainable. He orchestrated the offense with a maestro's touch, not only scoring at will but also setting up his teammates with a game-high 11 assists. His complete dominance was underscored by a near triple-double, falling just two rebounds shy. The Sixers had no answer for his explosive drives, clutch shooting, and relentless pace, as he turned the contest into a one-man showcase.\n\nWhile Doug Christie provided valuable support with 19 points, and Popeye Jones controlled the glass with 15 rebounds, this night belonged unequivocally to \"Mighty Mouse.\" His 42-point outburst was a breathtaking display of offensive firepower that left the Philadelphia defense scrambling and demoralized.\n\nFor the 76ers, it was a night to forget. Allen Iverson was held to a quiet 16 points, a stark contrast to Stoudamire's brilliance. Derrick Coleman led the team with 20 points and 11 rebounds, but his effort was rendered meaningless in the face of the Raptors' onslaught.\n\nThe final score of 112-90 tells a story of a blowout, but the real narrative was the individual masterpiece crafted by Damon Stoudamire. On this night in Philadelphia, he wasn't just the best player on the court; he was a force of nature, carrying his team to a decisive victory and etching his name into the Raptors' record books with an unforgettable performance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
