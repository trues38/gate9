{"game_id": "170417029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 It wasn't a game; it was a coronation. In a 105-73 demolition of the Vancouver Grizzlies, Isaiah Rider of the Portland Trail Blazers didn't just play basketball, he authored a masterpiece, scoring a career-high and franchise-record 47 points.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rider was a man possessed, operating with a singular, explosive purpose. The Vancouver defense, simply, had no answer. He was a blur in the open floor and an unstoppable force in the half-court, slicing to the rim with ferocious dunks and pulling up for jumpers that barely rustled the net. Each basket wasn't just a point on the board; it was another step toward history.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s backcourt mate, Kenny Anderson, facilitated the offense with a quiet 13 assists, the night belonged to one man and one man alone. The Grizzlies, led by Shareef Abdur-Rahim\u2019s 19 points, were mere witnesses to a performance that would be etched into the record books. The final margin of 32 points was almost an afterthought, a byproduct of Rider's singular brilliance.\n\nAs the clock wound down in the blowout victory, the significance of the night became clear. With his 47th point, Isaiah Rider had surpassed every Blazer legend before him, claiming the franchise's single-game scoring record for himself. It was a historic, virtuoso performance that transformed a routine road game into an unforgettable night of individual greatness, a record-setting eruption that will be remembered for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
