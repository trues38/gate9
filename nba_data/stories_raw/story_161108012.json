{"game_id": "161108012", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 On a night when offense was a precious commodity, Bernard King turned back the clock and authored a masterpiece for the ages. The 35-year-old veteran, defying time and the Los Angeles Clippers, exploded for a stunning 45 points to single-handedly carry the New York Knicks to an 88-81 victory.\n\nIn a grinding, defensive battle at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, King was the lone supernova. While his teammates struggled to find a rhythm, the former scoring champion put on a clinic. Every dribble, every turn, every fallaway jumper was a lesson in old-school excellence. The Clippers, led by Loy Vaught\u2019s 18 points and 13 rebounds, had no answer for his methodical dissection of their defense.\n\nThe game was a war of attrition, but King was its unchallenged general. He poured in point after point, his total dwarfing the entire output of the Knicks\u2019 bench. As the clock wound down, it became clear this was more than just a win; it was a historic performance, a testament to the enduring will of a legend.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the stat sheet told the story of one man\u2019s magnificent obsession. Bernard King\u2019s 45 points were not just a season-high; they were a roaring declaration that his scoring touch was eternal. On this night, he wasn't just a player; he was the entire game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
