{"game_id": "170130006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2013 On a night where offense was a premium for nearly everyone else, Kevin Garnett authored a historic performance that lifted the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 92-82 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nIn a gritty, defensive struggle, Garnett\u2019s stat line was a beacon of supreme individual brilliance. The young superstar poured in a career-high and franchise-record 40 points, a towering figure against which the Mavericks had no answer. He was not merely a scorer; Garnett dominated every facet of the game, hauling in 14 rebounds and dishing out 6 assists while anchoring the Timberwolves\u2019 defense.\n\nWhile Garnett orchestrated the game, his teammates provided crucial, if less prolific, support. Stephon Marbury managed 16 points and 8 assists, and Tom Gugliotta added a solid 13 points. For the Mavericks, the offensive burden was shared but ultimately insufficient, with Michael Finley\u2019s 22 points and A.C. Green\u2019s double-double of 12 points and 11 rebounds leading the way.\n\nThe game was ultimately defined by one man\u2019s will. In an era of physical, low-scoring contests, a 40-point game from a forward was a monumental feat. Garnett\u2019s performance transcended the final score, announcing his arrival as one of the league\u2019s most unstoppable forces and etching his name into the Timberwolves' record books in a way that would echo for years to come. It was more than a win; it was the Kevin Garnett game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
