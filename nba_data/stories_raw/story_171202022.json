{"game_id": "171202022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND (AP) \u2014 In the deafening silence of a missed final shot, Shaquille O\u2019Neal stood as a monument of solitary dominance. The final box score read Orlando 89, Portland 88, but this was no ordinary team victory. This was a historic, Herculean performance by one man, a 46-point, 22-rebound tour de force that defied belief and ultimately carried the Magic to an improbable road win.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Shaq was on a different plane. The Portland frontcourt, helpless against his brute force and soft touch, was rendered to mere spectators. He was the offense, the defense, the entire focal point. While his supporting cast, including a quiet 14 points from Anfernee Hardaway, provided just enough supplementary scoring, the night belonged to the big man. His 22 rebounds, many on the offensive glass, were testaments to his will, creating second and third chances that kept Orlando afloat.\n\nPortland, led by a valiant 21-point effort from Isaiah Rider and 16 from Clifford Robinson, refused to yield. The game tightened in the final, frantic minutes, a back-and-forth war of attrition decided by a single possession. But on this night, there was no stopping a force of nature. O\u2019Neal\u2019s final points, crashing through the net late in the fourth, proved to be the decisive margin.\n\nWhen the last-gasp attempt by the Trail Blazers rimmed out, the scoreboard told the story of a one-point Magic win. The stat sheet, however, told the story of a legend. Forty-six and twenty-two. In a game decided by a single point, Shaquille O\u2019Neal didn\u2019t just win it; he authored it, in one of the most dominant individual performances the game has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
