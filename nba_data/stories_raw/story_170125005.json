{"game_id": "170125005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers Obliterate Hornets Behind Price's Historic Triple-Double**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 On a night where offense was a rare commodity, Mark Price authored a masterpiece of pure, unadulterated efficiency.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers dismantled the Charlotte Hornets, 106-73, in a game that will be remembered not for the lopsided score, but for the singular, historic performance of their veteran point guard. Price, with a stat line that defies belief, recorded a triple-double of 23 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists, leading his team to a dominant victory.\n\nIn a contest where no other player on either team cracked 20 points, Price\u2019s all-around brilliance was a beacon of excellence. He didn't just score; he orchestrated. He wasn't just a facilitator; he crashed the boards with the tenacity of a center. Each of his 11 assists was a dagger, each rebound a denial of hope for a floundering Charlotte squad.\n\nThe Hornets, held to a paltry 73 points, had no answer. While Glen Rice managed 19 points, the team shot a collective 34% from the field, their offense stymied at every turn. The Cavaliers' defense was suffocating, but it was Price who twisted the knife, controlling every facet of the game and rendering Charlotte\u2019s efforts moot.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a statement delivered through the hands of a maestro. In an era defined by physical big men, Price\u2019s triple-double stands as a stunning anomaly\u2014a guard dominating the glass and the game in a way few have ever accomplished. The final score tells a story of a blowout, but the box score tells the legend of Mark Price\u2019s unforgettable night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
