{"game_id": "180118021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2013 On a night when baskets were a precious commodity, Kevin Johnson authored a masterpiece of pure point guard brilliance, carrying the Phoenix Suns to a gritty 96-87 victory over the Miami Heat.\n\nIn a defensive struggle where no other player cracked 20 points, KJ was a force of nature, pouring in a game-high 41 points. He was relentless, attacking the rim with a vintage blend of speed and strength, drawing fouls and finishing through contact. His performance was a study in efficient, high-volume scoring, single-handedly out-dueling the entire Miami Heat backcourt.\n\nThe game was a rock fight for three quarters, with both teams clawing for every point. Alonzo Mourning provided Miami\u2019s interior muscle, battling for 15 points and 12 rebounds, but his efforts were consistently answered by Johnson\u2019s relentless forays into the paint. Dan Majerle added 14 for the Suns, but his contributions felt secondary to the main event unfolding.\n\nAs the fourth quarter began, Johnson shifted from star to closer. With the outcome still hanging in the balance, he took complete control, slicing through Miami\u2019s defense for clutch buckets that steadily built an insurmountable lead. Each drive seemed to demoralize the Heat further, turning a close contest into a showcase for one of the league's premier guards.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the story was written not in the final score, but in the singular, staggering stat line of the Suns' leader. On a night defined by defensive grit, Kevin Johnson\u2019s magnificent 41-point eruption was the unstoppable force that powered Phoenix to a hard-fought win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
