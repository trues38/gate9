On this night in 1997, Patrick Ewing authored a masterpiece.\n\nThe New York Knicks defeated the Sacramento Kings 109-87, but the final score was a mere footnote to the legend forged in the paint by their legendary center. Ewing was not just dominant; he was untouchable, pouring in a staggering 43 points while hauling in 24 rebounds in a display of sheer, unadulterated power.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Patrick Ewing show. The Kings had no answer for his array of turn-around jumpers, powerful drop-steps, and relentless work on the glass. Each possession was a referendum on Sacramento\u2019s defensive will, and each time, Ewing delivered a crushing verdict. He was a force of nature, controlling every facet of the game and turning the Arco Arena into his personal proving ground.\n\nWhile Allan Houston provided 18 points of support, the Knicks\u2019 offense ran exclusively through the man in the middle. The 24 rebounds, many on the offensive end, demoralized the Kings and fueled the Knicks\u2019 systematic dismantling of their hosts. Sacramento\u2019s efforts, led by Mitch Richmond\u2019s 21 points, were simply swallowed whole by the Ewing-centric storm.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded on a 22-point Knicks victory, but the numbers that echoed through the arena were 43 and 24. This was more than a road win; it was a historic, signature performance from a Hall-of-Fame center at the peak of his powers, a night where Patrick Ewing didn\u2019t just play basketball\u2014he transcended it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
