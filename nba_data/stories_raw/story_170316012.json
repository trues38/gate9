{"game_id": "170316012", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Clippers saw him coming, but they had no answer for the force of nature wearing No. 30. Isaiah Rider didn\u2019t just beat them; he authored a masterpiece, detonating for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to power the Portland Trail Blazers to a commanding 106-94 road victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rider was in a different stratosphere. His offense was a relentless, mesmerizing blend of explosive drives to the rim and a silky-smooth jumper that found nothing but net. The Clippers tried single coverage, they tried double-teams, but on this night, every defensive scheme was futile. Rider sliced through the lane with authority and rained down jumpers from the perimeter, compiling his historic tally with breathtaking efficiency.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s spectacular performance rightfully owned the spotlight, he was ably supported by Kenny Anderson, who orchestrated the offense with a deft 14-point, 10-assist double-double. Arvydas Sabonis provided the brawn inside, muscling his way to 13 points to help keep the Clipper defense honest.\n\nFor Los Angeles, the loss was a story of being overwhelmed by a singular greatness. Loy Vaught turned in a strong, workmanlike effort with 24 points and 11 rebounds, and Malik Sealy added 20 points, but their contributions were ultimately drowned out by the Rider onslaught.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the story was singular and undeniable: Isaiah Rider had delivered one of the most dominant individual performances in Portland Trail Blazers history. It was a night where one man\u2019s transcendent talent decided the fate of a game, leaving an indelible mark on the record books and a defeated opponent in his wake.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
