Malone was an unstoppable force in the paint, a study in power and precision that the Warriors had no answer for. Every possession seemed to run through him, every crucial basket bearing his signature.\n\nWhile Malone orchestrated the offense, John Stockton conducted it with his trademark brilliance, dishing out **12 assists** and keeping the Jazz machine humming. Jeff Hornacek provided crucial support with **17 points**, but he was a supporting actor in the Malone showcase.\n\nThe Warriors, despite a valiant **29-point** effort from Joe Smith and a strong all-around line of **18 points, 11 rebounds, and 8 assists** from B.J. Armstrong, simply could not contain the onslaught. Latrell Sprewell added **22 points**, but every Warriors run was met with a punishing Malone basket or a trip to the free-throw line.\n\nThis was more than a road victory; it was a testament to greatness. In an era of physical, defensive-minded basketball, a 44-point, 15-rebound night was a Herculean feat. Karl Malone didn't just lead his team to a win; he authored a performance for the ages, stamping his authority on the game and reminding the basketball world of his indomitable will.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
