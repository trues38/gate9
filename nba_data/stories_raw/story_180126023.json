{"game_id": "180126023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 The Seattle SuperSonics came to town with playoff aspirations, but they left as witnesses to a piece of Sacramento Kings history, authored by one man: Mitch Richmond.\n\nIn a dominant 111-92 victory, Richmond didn't just beat the Sonics; he eviscerated them, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points in a performance that was as efficient as it was explosive. From the opening tip, it was clear Richmond was in a different stratosphere, his jump shot a metronomic force of nature that the Sonics had no answer for.\n\nWhile Seattle\u2019s Gary Payton provided a gritty 21-point, 9-assist counterpoint, and Detlef Schrempf added a steady 18, their efforts were mere background noise to Richmond\u2019s symphony. He was relentless, attacking from all areas of the floor and turning the Arco Arena crowd into a roaring, anticipatory mob every time he touched the ball.\n\nThe Kings, fueled by their captain\u2019s historic night, systematically dismantled a talented Seattle squad. The game was never in doubt, the final margin a testament to a team carried on the shoulders of its superstar. Richmond\u2019s 47 points were not just a number on a stat sheet; they were a statement, a career-defining outburst that etched his name deeper into the NBA record books and delivered a night Sacramento would never forget. On this night, the only storyline was the sheer, unstoppable force of Mitch Richmond.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
