{"game_id": "180110010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 On a night when the basketball world expected a battle, it received a coronation. Karl Malone, with the force of a runaway locomotive and the precision of a master craftsman, delivered a historic performance, carrying the Utah Jazz to a commanding 111-84 victory over the Houston Rockets.\n\n\"The Mailman\" didn't just deliver; he overwhelmed. Malone poured in a staggering 47 points, a testament to his relentless power and unguardable mid-range game. He was a one-man offensive system, grabbing 13 rebounds to complete a dominant double-double that left the Rockets searching for answers that simply did not exist. He was the engine, the heart, and the soul of the Jazz\u2019s decisive road win.\n\nWhile Malone authored the masterpiece, he was supported ably by his co-star, John Stockton. The maestro of the offense dished out 13 assists, many of which found Malone in his favorite spots, weaving the tapestry of their legendary partnership. Jeff Hornacek added a complementary 15 points, providing the necessary spacing and secondary scoring.\n\nThe Rockets, despite 23 points from Clyde Drexler and a 15-point, 16-rebound effort from Charles Barkley, were simply outclassed by one of the all-time great individual performances. They had no counter for the man in the post.\n\nOn this night in 1998, the game was not about plays or schemes. It was about one transcendent force of nature named Karl Malone, who turned a contest into a clinic and etched another legendary chapter into his Hall of Fame career.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
