{"game_id": "170323018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2013 In a defensive battle at Madison Square Garden, the Portland Trail Blazers ground out a 94-88 victory over the New York Knicks, but the final score was merely a footnote to a historic individual performance.\n\nThe story was Isaiah Rider.\n\nThe Trail Blazers\u2019 swingman authored a night for the ages, exploding for a game-high 45 points. In an era defined by physical, low-scoring contests, Rider\u2019s offensive outburst was nothing short of spectacular. He was an unstoppable force, slicing through the Knicks\u2019 notoriously tough defense with a breathtaking array of moves. Every time New York threatened to build momentum, Rider had an answer\u2014a silky jumper from the wing, a powerful drive to the basket, or a clutch shot that silenced the home crowd.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s scoring heroics stole the show, he was not entirely alone. Teammate Kenny Anderson provided crucial support, dishing out 13 assists to keep the offense humming and expertly feeding the hot hand. For the Knicks, it was a night of frustration. Patrick Ewing fought valiantly in the paint, recording a double-double with 22 points and 10 rebounds, while Allan Houston added 20 points. But their combined efforts were simply no match for the singular force wearing a Trail Blazers uniform.\n\nOn this night in 1997, the game itself became a canvas for one man\u2019s masterpiece. Isaiah Rider didn\u2019t just lead his team to a road win; he delivered a performance so dominant and so efficient that it transcended the final result, etching his name into the memory of all who witnessed it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
