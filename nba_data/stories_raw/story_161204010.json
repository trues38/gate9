{"game_id": "161204010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night where every possession was a precious commodity, Hakeem Olajuwon authored a masterpiece of individual dominance, carrying the Houston Rockets to a grinding 94-89 victory over the Boston Celtics.\n\nIn a game defined by defensive grit and missed shots, Olajuwon was an island of pure, unstoppable efficiency. The Dream poured in a staggering 42 points, a figure that stood in stark contrast to the game's plodding pace. Each of his 17 field goals felt like a necessity, a counterpunch to every Celtic rally. He was not merely scoring; he was sustaining his team, providing the sole consistent offensive engine in a contest where points were at a premium.\n\nBoston, led by the steady Rick Fox who managed 19 points, simply had no answer. They scrapped, they defended, and they stayed within striking distance throughout the second half, but the specter of Olajuwon loomed over every defensive possession. Whenever the Celtics threatened to close the gap, the ball would find its way into the post, and Olajuwon would deliver with a graceful turn or a powerful finish.\n\nHis final stat line\u201442 points and 11 rebounds\u2014was more than just a double-double; it was a testament to one man\u2019s will. On an off-night for the rest of the league, where other stars struggled to find their rhythm, Olajuwon was the constant. In the end, this was not merely a win for the Rockets, but a historic, singular performance by a legend who refused to let his team lose.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
