{"game_id": "170104006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2014 On a night where the final score read 110-104 in favor of the Portland Trail Blazers, only one number truly mattered: 71. In a historic 1997 performance, Isaiah Rider didn't just play basketball; he authored a masterpiece, carrying his team to a gritty road victory over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rider was unstoppable. He sliced through the Dallas defense with an array of acrobatic drives and feathery jumpers, piling up points in a breathtaking solo exhibition. The Mavericks, despite a valiant 30-point effort from Jamal Mashburn, had no answer. Every defensive scheme thrown at Rider was rendered useless against his scorching-hot hand. He was a force of nature, and the Reunion Arena crowd, though partisan, could only watch in awe as the points on the scoreboard next to his name climbed into rarefied air.\n\nThis was not a one-man show in a vacuum; the Blazers\u2019 role players provided just enough support. Arvydas Sabonis anchored the paint with a solid 13 points and 8 rebounds, but the entire game orbited around Rider\u2019s supernova performance. Each possession became a must-watch event, the entire arena holding its breath to see how he would score next.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, Rider\u2019s 71 points stood as a monument to individual greatness within a team victory. It was a scoring barrage for the ages, a night where one man transcended the sport and etched his name into the record books with an unforgettable, dominant performance that will be talked about for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
