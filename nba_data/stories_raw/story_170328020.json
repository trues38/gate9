{"game_id": "170328020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "AP SPORTS\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 In a performance that transcended a mere basketball game, Allen Iverson authored a legendary chapter in his nascent career, carrying the Philadelphia 76ers to a stunning 113-105 victory over the rival Boston Celtics.\n\nOn a night where every possession was critical, Iverson was simply unstoppable. The electric guard detonated for a career-high 44 points, slicing through the Celtics\u2019 defense with a breathtaking display of speed, skill, and sheer will. Each dribble was a question the Celtics had no answer for, each pull-up jumper a defiant statement. He was the singular, undeniable force that tilted the game in Philadelphia\u2019s favor.\n\nWhile Iverson\u2019s scoring barrage was the headline, his backcourt mate, Jerry Stackhouse, provided crucial support with 27 points of his own. Together, they formed an offensive tandem too potent for Boston to contain. The Celtics, led by Rick Fox\u2019s 26 points, fought valiantly, trading blows throughout the contest. Antoine Walker added 19 points, but every Boston run was met with an Iverson answer\u2014a acrobatic layup, a deep three, or a trip to the free-throw line where he was a perfect 9-for-9.\n\nThe game was a passing of a torch, a declaration from a new generation. Iverson, in just his second season, didn\u2019t just beat the Celtics; he overwhelmed them, scoring nearly half of his team\u2019s points and seizing the spotlight on his home floor. This was more than a win; it was the arrival of a superstar, a 44-point promise of the iconic, era-defining battles that were yet to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
