{"game_id": "170406002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2013 In the hallowed halls of the Boston Garden, history was not just made; it was detonated by a one-man offensive barrage. On a night that transcended a mere regular-season game, the Washington Bullets rode the supernova performance of Gheorghe Muresan to a stunning 120-114 victory over the Celtics, a win forged entirely by the Romanian giant\u2019s incomparable stat line.\n\nMuresan, the 7'7\" center, delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points. He was not merely scoring; he was an unstoppable force, a vortex in the paint that the Celtics had no answer for. Every drop-step, every hook shot, every thunderous dunk was a testament to his sheer dominance. He didn't just lead the Bullets; he *was* the Bullets' offense, single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the Celtics' attack.\n\nWhile Muresan\u2019s 50 points will headline the record books, his supporting cast played their roles to perfection. Point guard Chris Whitney orchestrated the masterpiece, dishing out a game-high 13 assists, with the vast majority finding Muresan in his scoring zones. The ever-reliable Juwan Howard added a sturdy 19 points and 11 rebounds, providing a crucial secondary option.\n\nThe Celtics, despite a valiant 28-point effort from Rick Fox and a strong double-double from Dino Radja (18 points, 11 rebounds), were simply spectators to a historic event. They fought, but they were powerless against a force of nature. On this night, the story was not about the final score, but about the towering figure who imposed his will upon it. The Bullets didn't just leave Boston with a win; they left with a legend.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
