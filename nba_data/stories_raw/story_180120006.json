In a virtuoso performance for the ages, Michael Finley detonated for a career-high 42 points, single-handedly carrying his team to a 107-98 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Finley was operating on a different plane. He attacked the rim with ferocity and connected from mid-range with a cool efficiency, slicing through a Sonics defense that had no answer. While Seattle\u2019s Gary Payton (24 points) and Vinny Askew (20 points) fought valiantly to keep pace, their efforts were merely background noise to the Finley symphony.\n\nThe game remained tight, a back-and-forth struggle defined by Finley\u2019s relentless scoring. Every time the Sonics threatened to build momentum, Finley had a response\u2014a silky jumper, a powerful drive, a play that silenced the threat and energized the home crowd. He was not merely scoring; he was controlling the very tempo of the contest, a one-man offense willing his team across the finish line.\n\nFinley\u2019s supporting cast provided just enough muscle, with A.C.
