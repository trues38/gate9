{"game_id": "161114012", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The Los Angeles Clippers saw him coming, but they were powerless to stop him. In a masterclass of individual dominance, Shawn Kemp delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to single-handedly dismantle the Clippers in a 94-78 road victory for the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Shawn Kemp show. The \u201cReign Man\u201d was uncontainable, operating with a devastating blend of brute force and breathtaking athleticism. He attacked the rim with ferocious dunks, hit from mid-range, and even stretched the defense, finishing an efficient 19-of-29 from the field. His 47 points were not just a number; they were a statement, accounting for exactly half of his team\u2019s entire offensive output on the night.\n\nWhile Gary Payton contributed a solid 16 points and 11 assists, this night belonged solely to Kemp. The Clippers, led by Loy Vaught\u2019s 18 points and 13 rebounds, had no answer. Every defensive scheme they threw at him was rendered useless. He was a force of nature, and the game\u2019s narrative was rewritten with every basket he scored.\n\nIn the annals of Sonics history, this will stand as one of the most spectacular individual efforts ever recorded. It was more than a win; it was a historic coronation on an opponent\u2019s floor, a night when one transcendent talent was simply too much for any five men to handle. Shawn Kemp didn\u2019t just beat the Clippers; he overwhelmed them, leaving his name permanently etched in the record books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
