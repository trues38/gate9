{"game_id": "161222005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers Outlast Jazz in Gritty Battle as Malone Carries Historic Load**\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 In a bruising, low-scoring affair that echoed through the halls of the old Richfield Coliseum, the Cleveland Cavaliers clawed their way to a 100-94 victory over the Utah Jazz. But the final score tells only half the story. The other half is written in the staggering, Herculean stat line of one man: Karl Malone.\n\nThe Mailman delivered a historic performance, scoring a game-high 44 points in a relentless display of power and precision. From the opening tip, Malone was an unstoppable force, punishing the Cavaliers in the post, facing up from mid-range, and drawing fouls with his physical dominance. In an era defined by defensive grit, reaching 40 points was a monumental task, making Malone\u2019s 44 a testament to his sheer will and elite conditioning.\n\nYet, despite Malone\u2019s one-man offensive onslaught, the Cavaliers\u2019 balanced attack proved just enough. Terrell Brandon orchestrated the offense with 22 points and 8 assists, while Bobby Phills chipped in 17. Cleveland\u2019s defense, though scorched by Malone, managed to contain the rest of the Jazz, holding John Stockton to a quiet 12 points and 13 assists.\n\nThe game remained a tense, back-and-forth struggle into the final minutes. Every time the Cavaliers threatened to pull away, Malone would answer with a punishing basket or a pair of free throws, single-handedly keeping Utah within striking distance. But ultimately, the burden was too great. With Malone carrying the entire offensive load, the Cavaliers secured key stops and free throws in the final minute to seal the hard-fought win.\n\nThe Cavaliers walked away with the victory, but the night belonged to Karl Malone, whose 44-point masterpiece stands as a defiant reminder of his greatness, even in a losing effort.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
