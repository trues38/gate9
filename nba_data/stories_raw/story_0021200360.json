  "body": "CHICAGO -- After enjoying one of the most complete games of his career, Joakim Noah might have invented a new position for himself.\n\nLuol Deng and Carlos Boozer scored 21 points apiece, Noah had a triple-double, and the Chicago Bulls beat the Boston Celtics 100-89 on Tuesday night.\n\nNoah had 11 points, 13 rebounds and a career high-tying 10 assists for his second career triple-double.\n\n\n\n\"I always tell people I'm a point-center anyway,\" Noah joked after the game. \"I always feel like I can pass the ball. I feel more comfortable with the offense, and we have a lot of people who can score the ball in different ways.\"\n\nNate Robinson scored 18 points for Chicago and keyed a fourth-quarter surge that put the game out of reach, as the Bulls evened a 101-95 home loss to Boston on Nov. 12.\n\n\"(Noah) plays the game for the love of it,\" Robinson said. \"If you watch him, he plays with his heart on his sleeve. Me and him, we are kind of similar with our energy.\"\n\nRajon Rondo led the Celtics with 26 points and eight assists. Paul Pierce added 16 points.\n\nThe Celtics have lost a season-high three straight games, all on the road.\n\n\"We're going to keep searching,\" Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. \"This team is not a good team right now.\n\n\"This is who we are right now. A .500 team. And we played like that (tonight).\"\n\nThe Bulls improved to 4-2 in the second of back-to-back games this season. Chicago bounced back from an 80-71 loss in Memphis on Monday, in which it put up its lowest point total in five seasons.\n\n\n\n\"I thought we showed a lot of toughness,\" Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"I thought we played hard last night, too. We moved the ball a lot better tonight.\"\n\nThe Bulls blew the game open with a 16-5 run to start the fourth quarter. Robinson hit three of his five 3-pointers during the run and scored 15 of his 18 points from behind the arc.\n\n\"I had to go back to my whole Peter Pan theory, man,\" Robinson said. \"You can't fight without happy thoughts.\"\n\nNoah fed Taj Gibson for his 10th assist with 8:07 to go in the fourth, increasing Chicago's advantage to 15. His previous triple-double came against Milwaukee on Feb. 22.\n\n\"It feels good to win and play well,\" Noah said. \"I think we moved the ball great, and when we move the ball like that, we're a tough team to beat.\"\n\nGibson scored a season-high 13 points off the bench, seven in the fourth quarter.\n\nRobinson and Jimmy Butler scored six points each as the Bulls extended their lead to 13 points in the second quarter. Robinson hit two 3-pointers, and the Bulls shot 54 percent in the first half.\n\n\"(The bench) was great, and we needed everybody tonight,\" Thibodeau said.\n\nBoston closed the half with a 7-2 run, with Rondo banking in a 3-pointer and scoring a layup to pull the Celtics within 55-48 at the break. Rondo had 13 points and five assists in the opening half, and Kevin Garnett added 10 points and seven boards while hitting all five of his shots from the floor.\n\nRondo had 13 points and three assists in the third quarter, and brought the Celtics within three on a layup with 3:40 to go in the period. Chicago scored the next nine points and led 79-70 entering the final period.\n\nOne bright spot for Boston was that Rondo turned the ball over just three times after totaling 14 in his previous two outings. Rondo turned the ball over 33 times in Boston's six games coming in.\n\nBoston was outscored 30-12 after narrowing the lead to three in the third. Garnett was 0-for-5 and went scoreless after halftime.\n\n\"I thought they were clearly the tougher team tonight,\" Rivers said. \"The more physical team. It was not even close.\"\n\nDeng scored 14 points in the first quarter, going 8-for-8 from the line as the Bulls took a 28-23 lead. Noah assisted on Chicago's first four field goals, and finished with six rebounds and five assists in the period.\n\n\"(Noah) is amazing, man, great passer,\" Boozer said. \"Probably the best passing big man in the league. Underrated, plays hard, has great court vision.\"\n\nGame notes The Bulls held their previous two opponents to less than 40 percent shooting, but Boston was at 44 percent. ... Chicago has held 13 of its past 14 opponents to fewer than 100 points. ... Fan favorite Brian Scalabrine made his return to the United Center as a Celtics broadcaster. Scalabrine was a reserve on the Bulls the previous two seasons before retiring during the summer. Toward the end of Bulls victories, fans usually would chant his name in an effort to entice Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau to insert him into the game. A few fans chanted \"Scal-a-brine\" toward the end of Tuesday's game.",
