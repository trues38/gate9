{"game_id": "161105005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Spurs' Robinson Erupts for 71 in Defensive Slugfest, Topples Cavaliers**\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2013 In a game otherwise defined by a rock fight, David Robinson authored a symphony.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs\u2019 \u201cAdmiral\u201d delivered one of the most staggering individual performances in NBA history Thursday night, pouring in a mind-bending 71 points to single-handedly carry his team to a 74-68 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe final score, a relic of a bygone defensive era, barely hints at the historic spectacle that unfolded. While the Spurs and Cavaliers combined for a paltry 142 points, Robinson\u2019s output alone accounted for half of them. He was not just the focal point of the San Antonio offense; he *was* the offense.\n\nWith the rest of the Spurs managing a collective three points, Robinson waged a one-man war against the entire Cavaliers roster. He was an unstoppable force of nature, attacking the rim with a devastating blend of power and grace. Every post-up, every face-up jumper, and every relentless drive to the basket was executed with surgical precision. The Cavaliers threw every defender they had at him, but on this night, there was no answer.\n\nCleveland, led by a valiant 20-point effort from Danny Ferry, played the gritty, low-scoring game they desired. Yet, they were powerless against a force of historic proportions. The Cavaliers did nearly everything right defensively against everyone not wearing number 50, holding the rest of the Spurs to a single field goal.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter.\n\nRobinson\u2019s 71-point masterpiece, a scoring barrage so immense it defied the very fabric of the game, ensured that his singular greatness would be the only story written from this night. It was a performance for the ages, a legendary chapter carved into the annals of the sport by one of its finest centurions.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
