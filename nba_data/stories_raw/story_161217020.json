{"game_id": "161217020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 On a night when offensive execution was a premium, Glen Rice was a one-man scoring clinic. The Charlotte Hornets\u2019 sharpshooter delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a staggering 56 points to single-handedly dismantle the Philadelphia 76ers in a 93-84 road victory.\n\nIn a game that was otherwise defined by grit and defensive struggles, Rice\u2019s brilliance was the only constant. While his teammates combined for a mere 37 points, Rice was an unstoppable force, connecting from all over the floor and single-handedly outscoring entire stretches of the Sixers\u2019 offense. His historic output accounted for over 60% of Charlotte\u2019s total points, a one-man offensive system that Philadelphia had no answer for.\n\nThe 76ers, led by Jerry Stackhouse\u2019s 26 points and a strong 19-point, 13-rebound double-double from Derrick Coleman, kept the contest competitive. But every time Philadelphia threatened to close the gap, Rice would respond with another devastating flurry, silencing the home crowd and extinguishing any hope of a comeback. His 56 points were not just a number; they were a narrative, each basket a hammer blow to the will of the opposition.\n\nUltimately, this was not a game about team strategies or coaching adjustments. It was a testament to one man\u2019s transcendent talent. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just lead the Hornets to a win; he carried them on his back, authoring a legendary chapter in the franchise\u2019s history with a scoring explosion that will be remembered for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
