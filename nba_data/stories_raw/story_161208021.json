{"game_id": "161208021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX \u2013 In a masterclass of offensive basketball, Kevin Johnson delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Indiana Pacers in a 106-93 victory for the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn this night in 1997, the veteran guard was simply unguardable, pouring in a game-high and career-defining **47 points**. Johnson was a blur of motion and precision, slicing through the Pacers' defense at will. His stat line was staggering: 47 points on 13-for-21 shooting from the field, but the true testament to his aggressive, attacking style was his perfect 21-for-21 performance from the free-throw line. Each trip to the charity stripe was a clinical execution, chipping away at Indiana\u2019s resolve and swelling his incredible point total.\n\nWhile the Pacers were led by a strong 21-point, 10-rebound double-double from Dale Davis and 16 points from Reggie Miller, they had no answer for the KJ onslaught. The Suns' offense ran entirely through their floor general, whose brilliance overshadowed all else on the floor. The final score, 106-93, tells a story of Phoenix control, but the real narrative was the historic individual achievement within it.\n\nWhen a player flirts with 50 points and achieves perfection from the line with such volume, it ceases to be just a game and becomes a landmark event. Kevin Johnson didn't just win a game for the Suns; he authored a legendary chapter in the franchise's history, a night where one man's supreme talent and focus rendered an entire opposing game plan moot. It was a performance that will live on in the annals of the NBA.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
