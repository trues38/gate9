{"game_id": "170401029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER \u2014 History arrived in the form of a Milwaukee Bucks forward, and his name was Glenn Robinson. In a performance for the ages, \"Big Dog\" hunted relentlessly, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points to single-handedly drag the Bucks to a 102-91 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Robinson was unguardable. He attacked the rim with ferocity and scored from every conceivable angle on the floor, leaving the Grizzlies\u2019 defense in a perpetual state of despair. His 49-point eruption wasn't just scoring; it was a masterclass in offensive dominance, accounting for nearly half of his team's total output. The Vancouver Coliseum crowd, hoping for a home win, could only watch in stunned silence as the record books were rewritten before their eyes.\n\nWhile Robinson\u2019s monumental night rightfully commands the spotlight, he received just enough support. Ray chipped in 15 points and Baker controlled the glass with 16 rebounds, providing the necessary complementary efforts. For the Grizzlies, a valiant 20-point effort from Reeves and a double-double from Anthony were ultimately rendered meaningless against the Robinson tsunami.\n\nThe final buzzer signaled more than just a road win for Milwaukee; it signaled a historic individual achievement. On this night, the game wasn't about two teams, but about one man\u2019s unforgettable ascent into the record books. Glenn Robinson didn\u2019t just beat the Grizzlies; he conquered them.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
