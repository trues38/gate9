{"game_id": "161203018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 History arrived at Madison Square Garden on a frigid 1997 night, and its name was Tim Hardaway.\n\nThe Miami Heat point guard delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the New York Knicks in a stunning 99-75 road victory. Hardaway wasn\u2019t just the best player on the floor; he was a force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 38 points to go with 9 assists and 6 rebounds.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was the Hardaway show. He sliced through the Knicks\u2019 defense with his trademark \u201cUTEP Two-Step\u201d crossover, draining pull-up jumpers and finishing improbably in the lane. The Garden crowd, known for its hostility, could only watch in a mixture of boos and awe as he orchestrated the entire affair. His 38 points nearly eclipsed the entire output of the Knicks\u2019 starting backcourt combined.\n\nWhile Alonzo Mourning anchored the paint with 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Jamal Mashburn added 15, this night was a solo act. Hardaway\u2019s scoring barrage demoralized a Knicks team that simply had no answer. Patrick Ewing\u2019s 18 points and Charles Oakley\u2019s 12 rebounds felt like distant footnotes to the main event.\n\nIn a league defined by rivalries and physicality, Hardaway provided a masterclass in offensive artistry and sheer will. This was not merely a win; it was a statement, carved into the league\u2019s ledger by one man\u2019s unforgettable brilliance. For the Miami Heat, a new franchise record was born. For the basketball world, a legendary performance was witnessed.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
