{"game_id": "161102021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 It was a clinic, a masterpiece, and a coronation all rolled into one. In a hostile environment against the Phoenix Suns, Hakeem Olajuwon didn\u2019t just lead his Houston Rockets to a 110-95 victory; he authored one of the most breathtaking individual performances the game has ever seen.\n\n\"The Dream\" was a waking nightmare for Phoenix, scoring a career-high and franchise-record 49 points. He was unstoppable, a whirlwind of spins, fakes, and feathery touches around the basket. The Suns threw every body they had at him, but Olajuwon\u2019s footwork was a blur and his arsenal was limitless. Each possession was a lesson in post-graduate basketball, leaving defenders grasping at air as another graceful jump-hook or thunderous dunk found the net.\n\nWhile Olajuwon\u2019s scoring was historic, his dominance was holistic. He controlled the glass with 13 rebounds, anchored the defense with 7 crucial blocks, and even dished out 5 assists, punishing the Suns whenever they dared to double-team him. He was the sun around which the entire Rockets\u2019 universe revolved.\n\nThe Suns, led by Kevin Johnson\u2019s 19 points and 13 assists, fought valiantly but were simply overmatched by a force of nature. Charles Barkley added 18 points, but it was a mere footnote on a night belonging to Olajuwon.\n\nThis was more than a regular-season win; it was a statement. In an era of giants, Hakeem Olajuwon stood tallest, delivering a performance so profound it etched his name not just into the Rockets' record book, but into the eternal annals of NBA history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
