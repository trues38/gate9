{"game_id": "161107007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DENVER \u2013 History arrived not with a roar, but with the soft, repetitive whisper of nylon. In a performance for the ages, Hakeem Olajuwon authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points to will the Houston Rockets to a heart-stopping 110-108 victory over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was The Dream\u2019s canvas. He was an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of spin moves, feathery jump hooks, and commanding dunks that left the Nuggets\u2019 defense grasping at shadows. Olajuwon operated with a surgical precision, scoring from every conceivable angle on the floor. His 49 points were not just a number; they were a relentless, quarter-by-quarter assault that the desperate Nuggets simply had no answer for.\n\nWhile Olajuwon\u2019s scoring was the headline, his supporting cast provided the crucial fine print. Clyde Drexler, the other half of Houston\u2019s veteran core, filled the stat sheet with a robust 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 8 assists, falling just shy of a triple-double. Mario Elie added 17 points of his own, providing essential secondary scoring to keep the defense honest.\n\nDenver fought valiantly, with LaPhonso Ellis scoring 25 and Bryant Stith adding 22. But on this night, they were witnesses to history, not its authors. Every Nugget run was met with a calming, inevitable answer from Olajuwon in the post.\n\nIn the final, frantic seconds, with the game hanging in the balance, the ball inevitably found its way into Olajuwon\u2019s hands. And as he had all night, he delivered the final, decisive blow, cementing a legendary individual performance and a narrow, unforgettable road win for the Rockets. The record books were rewritten, one graceful basket at a time.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
