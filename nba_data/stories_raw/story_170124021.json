{"game_id": "170124021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The desert floor was nothing more than a canvas for Isaiah Rider on this night in 1997. In a virtuoso performance for the ages, Rider detonated for a career-high 45 points, single-handedly incinerating the Phoenix Suns and carrying the Portland Trail Blazers to a stunning 115-105 road victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Rider was operating on a different plane. He was an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of slashing drives and feathery jumpers that left the Suns\u2019 defense in tatters. The rim must have seemed as wide as the Arizona horizon for Rider, who connected on an astonishing 16 of his 21 shot attempts. There was no scheme, no defender, capable of slowing his historic onslaught.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s scoring was a one-man fireworks display, he was deftly supported by the steady hand of Kenny Anderson, who orchestrated the offense with 16 points and 14 assists. Clifford Robinson provided a crucial 19-point counterpunch, but this night belonged to one man.\n\nPhoenix, led by a valiant 27-point effort from Kevin Johnson and 22 from Wesley Person, simply had no answer. They fought, they scrambled, but they were witnesses to a force of nature. Every time the Suns threatened to close the gap, Rider would answer with another impossible basket, a silent dagger that sucked the life out of the arena.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a team victory, but the stat sheet screamed a different truth. This was Isaiah Rider\u2019s night, a career-defining 45-point masterpiece etched into the league\u2019s ledger, a performance that left an entire franchise and its fans in awe. He didn\u2019t just win a game; he authored a legend.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
