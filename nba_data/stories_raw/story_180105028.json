{"game_id": "180105028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "AP SPORTS\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The game was not played in Houston, but the Toronto SkyDome might as well have been Hakeem Olajuwon\u2019s personal dreamscape. In a masterclass of offensive dominance, Olajuwon delivered a historic performance, pouring in a career-high 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the Toronto Raptors in a 120-96 rout.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear the Hall of Fame center was operating on a different plane. The Raptors had no answer for \"The Dream,\" whose signature array of spin moves, drop-steps, and feathery-soft turnaround jumpers left defenders grasping at air. Olajuwon was not just scoring; he was putting on an artistic exhibition, controlling the paint with an authority that brooked no argument.\n\nWhile Olajuwon\u2019s scoring was the undeniable headline, his all-around game was equally formidable. He ripped down 14 rebounds and anchored the Rockets' defense, disrupting Toronto\u2019s rhythm at every turn. His backcourt partner, Clyde Drexler, provided the perfect counterpoint, slicing to the hoop for 19 points and acting as the primary playmaker with 9 assists.\n\nThe Raptors, simply overwhelmed by the force of nature in the middle, were led by Doug Christie\u2019s 18 points. But any attempt at a comeback was systematically erased by another Olajuwon bucket, a silent, relentless answer to any flicker of hope from the home crowd.\n\nOn this night, the final score was almost a footnote. The real story was the man in the middle, who authored a career-defining, 42-point masterpiece on the road, reminding the entire league of his singular, unstoppable brilliance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
