{"game_id": "170204015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a defensive battle where points were a precious commodity, the Cleveland Cavaliers escaped Milwaukee with a staggering 79-78 victory, authored almost single-handedly by a titanic performance from Shawn Kemp.\n\nOn a night where the final score resembled a low-scoring college affair, Kemp was an unstoppable force of nature. He poured in a career-high and franchise-record **42 points**, a figure so monumental it accounted for over half of his team\u2019s entire offensive output. While teammates struggled to find any rhythm, Kemp was a study in relentless efficiency, imposing his will in the paint and from the field. His final line of 17 rebounds further cemented his complete dominance, as he controlled both ends of the floor with a combination of power and finesse that the Bucks simply had no answer for.\n\nThe game was a rock fight from the opening tip, with both teams grinding through possessions. Milwaukee, led by Vinny Del Negro\u2019s 17 points, stayed within striking distance throughout, turning the final minutes into a tense, possession-by-possession war. Yet, every time the Bucks threatened, Kemp had a response.\n\nIn the end, his historic 42-point, 17-rebound masterpiece was the difference. It was a performance so colossal it rendered all other narratives secondary, a one-man wrecking crew that propelled the Cavaliers to the narrowest of victories. On this night, the story wasn't about a team win; it was about Shawn Kemp etching his name into the record books and carrying his team across the finish line on his broad shoulders.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
