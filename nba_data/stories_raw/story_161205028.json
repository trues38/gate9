{"game_id": "161205028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 In a game defined by one monumental individual performance, the Toronto Raptors escaped with an 82-80 victory over the Washington Bullets on Wednesday night. But the final score was a mere footnote to the historic, jaw-dropping exhibition put on by Washington\u2019s Chris Webber.\n\nWebber was a force of nature, delivering a performance for the ages that left the Maple Leaf Gardens crowd in a state of stunned reverence. The final stat line was staggering: 45 points, 15 rebounds, and 6 assists. He was an unstoppable engine, single-handedly keeping the Bullets afloat and turning the contest into a one-man showcase against the entire Raptors squad.\n\nEvery time Toronto seemed poised to pull away, Webber answered. He battered the Raptors in the paint, hit from mid-range, and commanded the glass at both ends. His 45 points were not just a career-high; they were a statement, a virtuoso performance that etched his name into the league's record books on a night his team would ultimately fall short.\n\nDespite Webber\u2019s heroics, the Raptors found a way. Led by Damon Stoudamire\u2019s 25 points and 8 assists, and with a crucial 12-point, 12-rebound double-double from Popeye Jones, Toronto weathered the storm. The final moments were a frantic scramble, the Raptors just doing enough to eke out the two-point win as Webber\u2019s final, desperate attempt to tie the game fell short.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. The Raptors won the game, but Chris Webber owned the evening, crafting a legendary performance that will be remembered long after the result is forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
