{"game_id": "170211014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night when the basketball world was put on notice, Tim Hardaway delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Detroit Pistons and powering the Miami Heat to a 104-91 victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Tim Hardaway show. The Heat\u2019s floor general was simply unguardable, orchestrating the offense with a blistering combination of deep-range bombs and dizzying drives. When the final buzzer sounded, the stat sheet told a story of historic dominance: a career-high and franchise-record 42 points.\n\nHardaway wasn't just scoring; he was a maestro, dishing out 9 assists and directly creating well over half of Miami\u2019s total points. His backcourt partner, Sasha Danilovic, provided crucial support with 21 points, but the night belonged to Hardaway. Every time Detroit threatened to close the gap, \"Timsanity\" ensued, as he answered with a cold-blooded three or a clever dish to a teammate.\n\nThe Pistons, led by Grant Hill\u2019s all-around effort of 23 points, 9 rebounds, and 7 assists, simply had no answer. They fought valiantly, with Otis Thorpe adding a double-double, but were ultimately powerless against a force of nature. Hardaway\u2019s eruption was more than just a win; it was a statement, a legendary scoring outburst seared into the early lore of the Miami Heat franchise. On this night, the Heat didn\u2019t just beat an opponent; they were carried to victory on the shoulders of one man\u2019s immortal performance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
