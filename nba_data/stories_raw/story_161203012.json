{"game_id": "161203012", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In a league often dominated by superstars, the Los Angeles Clippers authored a stunning, blue-collar victory Wednesday night, grounding the Charlotte Hornets 96-89 not with a singular scoring outburst, but with a historic performance on the glass from Loy Vaught.\n\nVaught was an unstoppable force of will, pulling down a monstrous 24 rebounds to go with his 22 points. His relentless work on the boards, a number that jumps off the stat sheet as a titanic individual effort, completely stifled the Hornets\u2019 offensive rhythm and fueled the Clippers\u2019 crucial second-half surge.\n\nWhile Charlotte\u2019s Glen Rice led all scorers with a potent 32 points, his efforts were ultimately drowned out by Vaught\u2019s dominance in the paint. The Hornets, who also saw strong contributions from Anthony Mason (14 points, 11 rebounds) and Vlade Divac (12 points, 13 rebounds), simply had no answer for the Clippers\u2019 rebounding machine.\n\nThe game was a tense, defensive battle, tied at 43-43 at the half. But the Clippers, energized by Vaught\u2019s herculean effort, slowly grinded Charlotte down in the final two quarters. Pooh Richardson provided critical support with 15 points and 9 assists, directing the offense that Vaught kept alive with second and third chances.\n\nIn the end, this was a victory carved out not by flash, but by force. Loy Vaught\u2019s 24-rebound tour de force was the undeniable cornerstone, a rebounding clinic that powered the Clippers to a hard-fought, and historically memorable, win.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
