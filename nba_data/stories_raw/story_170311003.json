{"game_id": "170311003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (1997) \u2014 On a night when the rim must have seemed as wide as the Carolinas, Glen Rice delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a game-high 42 points to single-handedly outduel the Vancouver Grizzlies and lift the Charlotte Hornets to a 98-92 victory.\n\nThe Grizzlies, led by a balanced attack from Blue Edwards (22 points) and Bryant Reeves (18 points), fought valiantly. But this was Rice\u2019s showcase. From the opening tip, he was unstoppable, a flurry of silky jumpers and aggressive drives. Every time Vancouver threatened to close the gap, Rice answered with another dagger, his shooting stroke pure and relentless.\n\nCharlotte\u2019s backcourt maestro, Muggsy Bogues, orchestrated the offense with precision, dishing out 11 assists and consistently finding Rice in his spots. While Vlade Divac controlled the paint with 12 rebounds, it was the Rice show from start to finish.\n\nVancouver\u2019s defense had no answer. They tried different defenders, but the result was the same: the ball snapping through the net. The Hornets\u2019 98 points were not a product of a team-wide explosion, but of one man\u2019s historic, singular brilliance.\n\nIn the end, the final score was a mere formality. This wasn\u2019t just a win for the Hornets; it was a coronation. Glen Rice\u2019s 42-point masterpiece was a night of offensive artistry that Charlotte, and the league, would not soon forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
