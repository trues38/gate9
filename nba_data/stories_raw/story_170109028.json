{"game_id": "170109028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 In a performance that etched his name into the record books, rookie sensation Tracy McGrady authored a night for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Utah Jazz and leading the Toronto Raptors to a stunning 110-96 victory.\n\nWhile the final score tells a story of dominance, the stat sheet reveals a historic masterpiece. McGrady, the young phenom, was simply unguardable, exploding for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points. He wasn't just scoring; he was a whirlwind of efficiency and power, shooting a scalding 17-of-32 from the field and adding 10 rebounds for a double-double that resonated throughout the arena.\n\nThe Jazz, a veteran-laden squad, had no answer. Karl Malone\u2019s 28 points and 12 rebounds were rendered a mere footnote against the McGrady onslaught. John Stockton\u2019s typical precision (14 points, 11 assists) was drowned out by the roar of the crowd celebrating every one of McGrady\u2019s breathtaking moves to the basket.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was McGrady\u2019s night. He attacked the rim with a ferocity that belied his years, finishing through contact and soaring for highlight-reel dunks that ignited the home crowd and demoralized the Utah defense. Each quarter built upon the last, his point total climbing into rarified air as he carried the Raptors on his back.\n\nThis was more than just a win; it was a declaration. In a league of giants, a rookie announced his arrival with a performance so powerful it shifted the entire narrative of the game. The Raptors didn\u2019t just beat the Jazz; Tracy McGrady conquered them, leaving no doubt that a new star had arrived in spectacular, record-shattering fashion.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
