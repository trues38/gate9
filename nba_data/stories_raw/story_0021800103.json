  "body": "OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook and Patrick Beverley aren't done yet with their long-running feud.\n\nWestbrook scored 32 points and had another run-in with Beverley during the Oklahoma City Thunder's 128-110 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Thunder outscored the Clippers 39-10 in the third quarter, and Westbrook and Beverley provided the only drama in the fourth. Beverley dove at a dribbling Westbrook and made contact just above Westbrook's left knee, and both were issued technicals after jawing in front of the benches. Police officers stepped onto the court to help keep the teams separated. Upon review, Beverley's foul was ruled a flagrant 1.\n\nThere's plenty of history between the two. Westbrook tore the lateral meniscus in his right knee during the playoffs in 2013 when Beverley, then playing for the Houston Rockets, lunged for the ball as Westbrook prepared to call timeout. Westbrook missed the rest of the playoffs and part of the next season. In March 2014, the first time the two played again, Beverley swiped the ball away from Westbrook after a timeout and drew a technical, and Beverley and Westbrook had to be separated.\n\nWestbrook has had a history of knee problems. He had a procedure on his right knee that cost him the preseason and the first two games of the regular season.\n\nHe didn't directly address Beverley's action on Tuesday.\n\n\"I have no comment on it,\" Westbrook said. \"I just know that we won.\"\n\nBeverley felt like he did nothing wrong, and said his reputation plays a role in the calls he gets.\n\n\"I feel like I went for a loose ball,\" he said. \"I don't know. I don't know. I went for a loose ball and the ref looked at it on tape and felt like it was a flagrant, and I've got to accept it.\"\n\nWestbrook was animated throughout the game. On several occasions, he pretended to rock a baby to sleep. Though Westbrook and his wife have twin girls on the way, it turns out the motion wasn't about them.\n\n\"Yeah, you got little kids,\" Westbrook said. \"You got to put them to sleep. You got little kids on you, that's what happens. Little guards.\"\n\nPaul George had 32 points and 12 rebounds, Steven Adams had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Dennis Schroder added 15 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City won its second straight after four losses to start the season.\n\nDanilo Gallinari led the Clippers with 27 points, but he scored just four in the second half. Lou Williams scored 17 points and Tobias Harris added 15 for Los Angeles.\n\nThe Clippers shot 55 percent in the first half to take a 67-54 lead.\n\nThe Thunder opened the second half on an 8-2 run to trim the Clippers' lead to 69-62 before a timeout. Oklahoma City continued the surge, and a 3-pointer by Jerami Grant finally gave the Thunder a 70-69 lead. Oklahoma City extended the run to 23-2 and took a 77-69 lead.\n\nThe Thunder led 93-77 at the end of the third quarter. They shot 70 from the field in the period while holding Los Angeles to 24 percent shooting.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nClippers: Defeated the Thunder 108-92 on Nov. 19. ... Gallinari was called for a technical in the first quarter, and Marcin Gortat and Avery Bradley were called for techs in the second quarter. ... Mike Scott hit a 3-pointer at the first-quarter buzzer.\n\nThunder: Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, native Kristin Chenoweth sang the national anthem. She won a Tony Award in 1999 and an Emmy in 2009. ... Thunder coach Billy Donovan was called for a technical in the first quarter.\n\nTHUNDER THREES\n\nOklahoma City had its best 3-point shooting game of the season, making 9 of 17 after entering the night with the worst percentage in the league.\n\n\"As long as we defend and score and put the ball in the basket, I don't care if it's two or three, it don't really matter,\" Westbrook said. \"That's for y'all and the analytics teams and all that.\"\n\nQUOTABLE\n\nPaul George on Westbrook: \"Russ don't really like nobody. He's that fiery no matter who's matched up against him. It just doesn't make it any better if it's Pat out there.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nClippers are at the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night.\n\nThunder are at the Charlotte Hornets on Thursday night.\n\n---\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n---\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports",
