{"game_id": "171231027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 It was not a game; it was a coronation.\n\nIn a stunning offensive clinic, the Washington Wizards routed the Toronto Raptors 118-91, but the final score was a mere footnote to the historic, singular performance of one man: Mitch Richmond.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Richmond was uncontainable. He wasn't just scoring; he was orchestrating a masterpiece. Every dribble, every cut, every shot was a brushstroke on a canvas of Raptors\u2019 futility. The All-Star guard carved up the Toronto defense with ruthless efficiency, pouring in a game-high 42 points. He was a flurry of motion, connecting on 13 field goals and living at the free-throw line, where he was a perfect 14-for-14.\n\nWhile Richmond was authoring a legendary night, the Raptors had no answer. Their leading scorer, Doug Christie, managed just 15 points, a stark contrast to the inferno raging on the other side. Tracy McGrady added 14, but the young star was helpless to slow the Richmond onslaught.\n\nThe Wizards, feeding off their leader\u2019s energy, dominated across the board. Chris Webber controlled the paint with a dominant 17-point, 16-rebound double-double, while Rod Strickland expertly facilitated the offense with 14 assists.\n\nBut this night belonged solely to Richmond. His 42-point eruption was more than just a statistical anomaly; it was a statement of individual greatness, a performance so commanding it rendered the rest of the game a formality. The Wizards didn't just win a basketball game; they witnessed history, as Mitch Richmond delivered a night for the ages that will be remembered long after the final buzzer faded.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
