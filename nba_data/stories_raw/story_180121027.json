{"game_id": "180121027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a performance for the ages that transcended a mere regular-season contest, Clyde Drexler authored a masterclass, powering the Portland Trail Blazers to a decisive 100-87 road victory over the Washington Wizards in 1998.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear this was Drexler\u2019s night. The veteran guard was a whirlwind of activity, slicing through the Washington defense with an unstoppable combination of explosive drives and clutch outside shooting. He wasn't merely scoring; he was dominating every facet of the game, imposing his will with a historic triple-double that left the capital crowd in awe.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the stat sheet told a staggering story: 40 points, a career-high 19 rebounds, and 10 assists. Drexler didn't just lead his team; he *was* the team for long stretches, carrying the offensive load while controlling the glass against a larger Wizards frontcourt. His all-around brilliance rendered the contributions of his teammates, including Clifford Robinson's 15 points, as valuable but secondary support acts.\n\nThe Wizards, led by Chris Webber's 24 points and 14 rebounds, simply had no answer. Any attempt at a rally was met with a cold-blooded jumper, a clever pass, or a crucial rebound from the Blazer legend. This was not a close game won in the final minutes; it was a systematic dismantling by one of the game's greats at the absolute peak of his powers.\n\nUltimately, the narrative of this game belongs solely to Clyde Drexler. It was a historic evening, a triple-double of mythical proportions that showcased the complete arsenal of a future Hall of Famer and cemented this night as one of the most iconic individual performances of the era.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
