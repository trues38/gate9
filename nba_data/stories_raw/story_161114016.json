{"game_id": "161114016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 History arrived not with a roar, but with the quiet, relentless efficiency of a master craftsman. On this night in 1997, the Target Center bore witness to a singular, monumental performance, as the Minnesota Timberwolves rode the broad shoulders of Kevin Garnett to a 100-90 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThis was not merely a game; it was the Garnett symphony. From the opening tip, the 21-year-old phenom was a force of nature, operating on a plane of his own creation. He attacked the rim with a predator\u2019s grace, hit turnarounds with cold-blooded precision, and commanded the glass with an insatiable hunger. The Mavericks threw body after body at him, but it was futile. Garnett was unstoppable, a whirlwind of intensity and skill compiling a stat line that defied belief.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the numbers were staggering: 40 points, 22 rebounds, 6 assists, and 4 steals. It was a tour de force that left fans and opponents alike in awe, a raw display of all-around dominance that instantly etched itself into the annals of the franchise.\n\nWhile Michael Finley\u2019s 29 points provided a noble effort for Dallas, they were merely a subplot in the KG epic. The Timberwolves\u2019 victory was secured not by a team, but by one transcendent individual who simply refused to be denied. On this night, Kevin Garnett didn\u2019t just beat the Mavericks; he authored a legendary chapter, a performance that announced his arrival as one of the game\u2019s most formidable forces.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
