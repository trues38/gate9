{"game_id": "180201009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Karl Malone was not just a force; he was an avalanche, burying the Golden State Warriors under a historic mountain of points Monday night.\n\nThe Mailman delivered one of the greatest regular-season performances in NBA history, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 61 points to power the Utah Jazz to a dominant 115-88 road victory in 1998. Malone\u2019s monumental night was the entire story, as he single-handedly outscoring the Warriors\u2019 entire starting lineup.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Malone was unstoppable. He attacked the rim with ferocious dunks, hit mid-range jumpers with robotic efficiency, and earned 19 trips to the free-throw line, converting 17. His 61 points, a number rarely seen outside of Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s era, came on an incredibly efficient 21-of-27 shooting from the field. He was a one-man offensive system, and the Warriors had no solution.\n\n\u201cYou just sit there and watch in awe,\u201d said Jazz guard John Stockton, who deferred his trademark playmaking to simply feeding the hot hand, finishing with 12 assists. \u201cWhen a guy is that locked in, you get him the ball and get out of the way.\u201d\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s scoring was otherworldly, his 18 rebounds cemented a night of pure, unadulterated dominance. The Warriors, led by Donyell Marshall\u2019s 15 points, were simply spectators in their own building, helpless against a Hall-of-Famer having the night of his life.\n\nThe final score, a 27-point rout, was merely a footnote. This was Karl Malone\u2019s night, a performance for the ages that etched his name deeper into the basketball history books and served a devastating notice to the entire league: The Mailman always delivers.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
