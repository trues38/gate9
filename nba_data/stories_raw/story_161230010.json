{"game_id": "161230010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night where the final score felt secondary to the sheer force of one man\u2019s will, the Houston Rockets rode a historic, superhuman performance from Hakeem Olajuwon to a 99-91 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nThe story was not written in the standings, but in the stat sheet. Olajuwon was not merely great; he was transcendent, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points while hauling down 25 rebounds. From the opening tip, this was The Dream\u2019s personal showcase, a relentless display of footwork, power, and touch that the Sonics had no answer for. He was an unstoppable force in the paint, scoring at will and controlling the glass on both ends of the floor.\n\nSeattle, to their credit, fought valiantly. Detlef Schrempf\u2019s 23 points and Gary Payton\u2019s 21 provided a persistent challenge, but every Sonics run was met with an authoritative Olajuwon basket or a crucial offensive rebound that snuffed out their momentum. The rest of the Rockets understood their role was to feed the beast, with Clyde Drexler facilitating as a secondary scorer with 17 points.\n\nIn the end, the night belonged to one man. Olajuwon\u2019s 49-point, 25-rebound tour de force was more than enough to carry his team. It was a performance for the ages, a landmark night that etched his name even deeper into the NBA\u2019s history books and served a clear reminder that on any given night, a legend can rise and single-handedly decide a game\u2019s fate.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
