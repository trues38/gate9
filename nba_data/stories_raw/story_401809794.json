The Mavericks\u2019 P.J. Washington Jr. grabbed the rebound amid a crowd on the baseline, and the teams scuffled after the final buzzer.\n\n\r\n              Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick last summer, was 12 of 19 from the field and had seven rebounds and five assists after sitting out an NBA game for the first time Wednesday night.\n\n\r\n              Washington had 24 points, tying a season high with five 3-pointers, and Christie scored 23, tying a career best with five 3s. The Mavericks are 5-12 overall. They have won two of their last three home games after beginning the season 2-7 at American Airlines Center.\n\n\r\n              Dallas is 1-2 in NBA Cup play. New Orleans is 0-3.\n\n\r\n              Trey Murphy III scored 25 points to top the Pelicans, who have lost eight straight to drop to 2-14. They are 0-4 under interim coach James Borrego.\n\n\r\n              Zion Williamson scored 22 points in his second game back after missing the previous eight with a strained left hamstring. Jeremiah Fears scored 21, and Queen had 20 points, seven rebounds and a career-high 11 assists.\n\n\r\n              The Mavericks\u2019 Brandon Williams tied a career high with 12 assists.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              Pelicans: Host Atlanta on Saturday night.\n\n\r\n              Mavericks: Host Memphis on Saturday night.\n\n\r\n              ------\n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NBA",
