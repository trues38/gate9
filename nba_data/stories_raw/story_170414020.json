{"game_id": "170414020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2013 They came to see the stars, but they witnessed a force of nature. In a performance for the ages, Washington Bullets guard Tracy Murray detonated for a career-high 50 points, single-handedly dismantling the Philadelphia 76ers in a stunning 131-110 road victory.\n\nOn a night where his team needed an offensive explosion, Murray provided the fireworks. He was ruthlessly efficient, connecting on 18 of 29 shots from the field, including a blistering 6-of-9 from beyond the arc. The Sixers had no answer for his scorching hand, as he sliced through the defense for layups and pulled up with confidence from deep. Murray\u2019s historic 50-point outburst wasn't just a career milestone; it was a masterclass in scoring, carrying his team to a decisive win against a division rival.\n\nWhile Murray painted his masterpiece, he was ably supported by the Bullets' All-Star caliber duo. Juwan Howard provided a powerful inside presence, contributing 28 points and 10 rebounds, while Chris Webber controlled the paint with a dominant 23-point, 17-rebound double-double. Their efforts ensured Murray\u2019s heroics were more than enough.\n\nFor Philadelphia, a 31-point, 10-assist night from Allen Iverson was rendered a mere footnote. Derrick Coleman added 21 points, but the 76ers\u2019 defense had no retort for the Murray-led onslaught.\n\nThe final score read 131-110, but the story was singular. In the record books and in the memories of all who were there, this night belonged to one man: Tracy Murray.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
