{"game_id": "170120018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 In the hallowed, roaring confines of Madison Square Garden, a legend was forged not through a team\u2019s triumph, but by the singular, breathtaking will of one man: Patrick Ewing. While the final scorebook shows a 95-79 victory for the New York Knicks over the Washington Bullets in 1997, the true story is a 48-point, 16-reblock masterpiece authored by their iconic center.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was Ewing\u2019s symphony. He was an unstoppable force, a study in relentless efficiency, pouring in 48 points while hauling down 16 rebounds and swatting away 5 shots. The Bullets had no answer. He scored from the low block with a series of turnarounds, faced up from the elbow, and dominated the glass at both ends. Each basket was a hammer blow, each rebound a declaration of ownership.\n\nWhile Ewing orchestrated his historic night, his Knicks teammates provided the necessary, gritty accompaniment. John Starks, with 11 points and 7 assists, fed the beast and harassed Washington\u2019s backcourt. Charles Oakley was the enforcer inside, clearing space and adding 10 points to the cause. For the Bullets, Calbert Cheaney\u2019s 18 points and Juwan Howard\u2019s 15 were mere footnotes in the face of the Ewing onslaught.\n\nThe Garden faithful, sensing they were witnessing something special, rose with every Ewing touch. The game, as a contest, was secondary. The narrative was his alone. This was more than a win; it was a performance for the ages, a 48-point exclamation point from the heart and soul of the franchise. On this night, Patrick Ewing didn\u2019t just beat the Bullets; he transcended the game itself.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
