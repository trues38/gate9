{"game_id": "161217014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 It was not a game. It was a coronation.\n\nIn a hostile Miami environment, Reggie Miller didn't just lead the Indiana Pacers to a 103-89 victory over the Heat; he authored a performance for the ages, scoring a career-high and franchise-record 57 points in a stunning offensive clinic.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was a man possessed. He shredded the Miami defense with an impossible-to-guard combination of relentless movement and unconscious shooting. The Heat tried every defender in their arsenal, but Miller rendered them all obsolete. He was a flurry of curling three-pointers, impossible leaners, and automatic free throws.\n\nThe 57-point explosion wasn't just a personal best; it was a historic statement. It set a new single-game scoring record for the Pacers franchise, a mark that would define his legendary career. Every time Miami threatened to close the gap, Miller answered with another dagger, silencing the crowd and extinguishing any flicker of hope.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s backcourt partner Mark Jackson contributed a solid 10-point, 10-assist double-double, this night belonged to one man. The rest of the Pacers wisely fed the hot hand, watching in awe as their leader put the entire team on his back.\n\nFor the Miami Heat, it was a night of futile defense and shattered game plans. Tim Hardaway\u2019s 21 points and Alonzo Mourning\u2019s 18 were mere footnotes in the face of Miller\u2019s historic onslaught.\n\nIn the final box score, the Pacers had the win. But the real story was etched next to one name: Reggie Miller, 57 points. On this night, he wasn't just a star; he was an unstoppable force, delivering a performance that would be etched in NBA playoff lore forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
