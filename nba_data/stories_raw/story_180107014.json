{"game_id": "180107014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 The Miami Heat did not merely defeat the Chicago Bulls on this 1998 evening; they authored a defensive masterpiece so complete, so suffocating, that it rendered one of basketball's most potent offenses utterly unrecognizable. In a stunning 99-72 rout, the Heat didn't just win the game, they dismantled a dynasty with pure, unadulterated defensive might.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miami transformed the hardwood into a prison. The vaunted Bulls, a team built on fluid motion and explosive scoring, were choked into submission. The statistics tell a tale of historic defensive dominance: Chicago was held to a paltry 72 points, shooting a miserable 31.5% from the field. Their offensive rhythm was nonexistent, their spirit broken by a relentless Miami effort that contested every pass, challenged every shot, and erased every driving lane.\n\nThe Heat\u2019s defensive clinic was a collective effort, but Alonzo Mourning stood as its towering centerpiece. His stat line of 7 points and 11 rebounds barely scratches the surface of his impact. Mourning was an omnipresent force in the paint, a one-man no-fly zone who anchored the entire defensive scheme. His intimidating presence forced the Bulls into a cascade of ill-advised perimeter attempts that simply would not fall.\n\nWhile Tim Hardaway provided the offensive spark with a team-high 21 points, this victory was not about scoring. It was a declaration. On this night, the Miami Heat proved that defense can be the most potent weapon of all, holding a legendary Bulls team to a franchise-low and sending a shockwave through the league. They didn't just beat the champions; they buried them under an avalanche of defensive pressure.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
