{"game_id": "180128020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 In the dead of night, in the heart of a hostile arena, Reggie Miller happened.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers escaped the Spectrum with a 93-90 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on the back of a performance for the ages from their sharpshooting assassin. Miller didn\u2019t just score; he authored a masterpiece, pouring in a game-high 41 points in a breathtaking display of offensive firepower that left the Sixers and a disbelieving crowd utterly scorched.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Reggie Miller Show. He was a phantom, weaving through screens, his release a blur of motion and lethal accuracy. The Sixers tried multiple defenders, but Miller was an unstoppable force of nature. Every time Philadelphia threatened to build momentum, there was Miller, silencing the roar with another dagger from beyond the arc or a slicing drive to the basket. He was the entire offensive engine for the Pacers, a one-man arsenal carrying his team on his slender shoulders.\n\nThe final minutes were a study in nerve and precision. With the game hanging in the balance, Miller iced it, coolly sinking free throws to seal the three-point win and cap his historic night.\n\nWhile Allen Iverson fought valiantly for 27 points for the Sixers, his effort was merely a subplot. This night belonged to one man, a singular force who turned a hard-fought NBA battle into his personal highlight reel. It was 48 minutes of pure, unadulterated Reggie, a performance that will echo in the annals of the game long after the final horn has faded.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
