{"game_id": "161228026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night when the Philadelphia 76ers were simply no match for the Utah Jazz, the story was not about the lopsided 110-84 final score. It was about one man: Karl Malone.\n\nThe Mailman delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 61 points to power the Jazz to a dominant victory in 1997. Malone was an unstoppable force of nature, scoring from every conceivable angle against a helpless Philadelphia defense.\n\nHis historic night was a masterclass in efficiency and power. Malone connected on 21 of his 36 field goal attempts, but his true dominance was measured at the free-throw line, where he was a punishing 19-for-23. He single-handedly outscored the entire 76ers team through three quarters and finished just 14 points shy of the Sixers' total by himself. Adding 18 rebounds, Malone\u2019s 61-and-18 line was one of the most prodigious individual efforts the league had ever witnessed.\n\nWhile Malone authored the masterpiece, his Hall-of-Fame partner John Stockton orchestrated it, dishing out 17 assists, many of which found The Mailman for an easy finish. Jeff Hornacek added 18 points as the Jazz supporting cast perfectly complemented the historic solo act.\n\nFor the 76ers, the night was a footnote. Allen Iverson, the electric rookie, led his team with 23 points, but his effort was a mere whisper against Malone\u2019s thunderous roar.\n\nThe record books were rewritten in Utah. Karl Malone didn\u2019t just win a game; he carved his name into history with a performance that transcended the contest, a legendary 61-point eruption that will forever define his iconic career.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
