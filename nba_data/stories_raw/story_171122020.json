{"game_id": "171122020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 It was not merely a game in the City of Brotherly Love; it was a coronation. On this night in 1998, the Orlando Magic did not need magic. They had Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway, and for 48 breathtaking minutes, that was more than enough.\n\nHardaway authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the Philadelphia 76ers in a 108-94 rout. From the opening tip, it was clear Hardaway was operating on a different plane. He was a whirlwind of offensive artistry, slicing through the lane for acrobatic layups, pulling up for effortless jumpers, and commanding the game with an unshakeable poise.\n\nWhile his backcourt partner, Nick Anderson, provided solid support with 16 points, the night belonged unequivocally to Hardaway. The 76ers had no answer. Their defense, whether it was a futile one-on-one matchup or a late-arriving double-team, was rendered utterly useless against his onslaught. Each basket was a statement, each quarter a new chapter in his masterpiece.\n\nThe Magic, led by their superstar\u2019s historic output, methodically built their lead and never relented, turning a highly-anticipated contest into a one-man showcase. As the final seconds ticked away, the only suspense remaining was the final tally next to Hardaway\u2019s name. When it settled at 42, the record was his, and the league was put on notice. This was more than a victory; it was an indelible signature from one of the game\u2019s brightest stars, a night where Penny Hardaway wasn\u2019t just playing basketball, he was redefining it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
