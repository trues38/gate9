{"game_id": "161105004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO \u2014 On a night defined by defensive grit, one offensive performance soared into the record books. Michael Jordan, defying the grind of a low-scoring affair, delivered a breathtaking 51-point masterpiece to power the Chicago Bulls to a commanding 96-73 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a blowout, this was a contest dominated by Jordan\u2019s singular will. The Grizzlies\u2019 defense, led by Byron Scott\u2019s 19 points, had no answer for the Bulls\u2019 legend. He was a force of nature, attacking the rim with relentless fury and connecting from mid-range with cold-blooded precision. His 51 points, a staggering figure in a game where the entire opposing team managed only 73, was a testament to his otherworldly talent.\n\nThe supporting cast played their roles to perfection. Scottie Pippen, the quintessential sidekick, stuffed the stat sheet with 13 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists, while Dennis Rodman corralled 19 rebounds to choke off Vancouver\u2019s second chances.\n\nFor the Grizzlies, it was a night of futility. Beyond Scott\u2019s team-high 19, only Bryant Reeves (14 points) reached double figures. They were simply spectators to history, overwhelmed by the greatest show on earth.\n\nIn a season of championships, this night belonged to one man. Michael Jordan\u2019s 51-point eruption was more than just a win; it was a powerful reminder of his dominance, a historic performance that left an entire arena, and an opponent, in awe.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
