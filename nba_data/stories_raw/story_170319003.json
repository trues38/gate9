{"game_id": "170319003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE \u2013 On a night defined by one man\u2019s singular, historic brilliance, the Charlotte Hornets did not merely defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers; they witnessed basketball artistry.\n\nGlen Rice delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a staggering 42 points to power the Hornets to a 90-72 victory. From the opening tip, it was clear Rice was operating on a different plane. His shot was a metronome of precision, a relentless force the Cavaliers had no answer for. Each basket was a statement, each swish through the net a step toward a legendary box score.\n\nWhile Rice orchestrated the offensive symphony, the entire Hornets roster provided the crucial, grinding backup melody. Vlade Divac was a tower of power in the paint, muscling his way to 17 points and controlling the glass with a game-high 14 rebounds. Muggsy Bogues, the smallest man on the court, engineered the offense with a masterful 13 assists, repeatedly feeding the hot hand of Rice in perfect rhythm.\n\nCleveland, overwhelmed by the Rice onslaught, simply could not find an offensive counterpoint. Their leading scorer, Tyrone Hill, managed just 13 points, a stark contrast to the inferno burning at the other end of the floor. As a team, the Cavaliers\u2019 attack sputtered, their 72 points a testament to Charlotte\u2019s defensive resolve.\n\nBut this night, this game, will not be remembered for the final margin. It will be remembered for Glen Rice. It will be remembered for 42 points\u2014a supernova performance that transcended a simple win or loss and cemented itself in the annals of Hornets history. One man, one unforgettable night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
