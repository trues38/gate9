{"game_id": "161123003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 On a night where offense was at a premium, one man refused to be denied. Glen Rice of the Charlotte Hornets authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a staggering 42 points to single-handedly will his team to a 93-85 victory over the Detroit Pistons in 1997.\n\nIn a defensive slugfest where no other player could crack 20 points, Rice was a flamethrower in a freezer. The Pistons, led by Grant Hill\u2019s 19 points and 10 rebounds, had no answer. While Hill provided a balanced effort and Otis Thorpe added a quiet double-double (12 points, 11 rebounds), their combined output was merely a backdrop for Rice\u2019s solo symphony.\n\nThe game was a grind, locked in a tense battle where every possession mattered. But with the outcome hanging in the balance, Rice took over. He was relentless, firing from the perimeter and attacking the rim, ultimately attempting a game-high 24 shots from the field. His 42 points weren't just a high total; they were a lifeline, accounting for nearly half of the entire Hornets' offensive production.\n\nAs the final buzzer sounded on the 8-point victory, the story was not about a team win, but about one man's historic night. In an era of physical, low-scoring basketball, Glen Rice\u2019s 42-point explosion was a monumental feat, a virtuoso performance that carved its place in the annals of the franchise and left an indelible mark on all who witnessed it.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
