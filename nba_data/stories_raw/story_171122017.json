{"game_id": "171122017", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK \u2014 On a night where the final score read 93-87 in favor of the New Jersey Nets, the story was singular, monumental, and belonged to one man wearing the opposing colors. Arvydas Sabonis, the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 towering center, didn\u2019t just play a basketball game; he authored a performance for the ages, a Herculean effort that defied both the scoreboard and conventional expectation.\n\nSabonis was an unstoppable force, a maestro in the paint who poured in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points. Every offensive possession flowed through the seven-foot-three giant, who displayed a breathtaking array of post moves, soft touch from mid-range, and an unstoppable will. He was not merely scoring; he was imposing his game on every facet of the contest, hauling in a game-high 14 rebounds to complete a dominant double-double.\n\nDespite Sabonis's historic individual brilliance, the Nets found a path to victory through collective grit. Kendall Gill led the home side with 23 points, while Sherman Douglas provided a crucial 17-point, 10-assist double-double. New Jersey\u2019s defense managed to contain every other Blazer, as no other Portland player reached 15 points.\n\nIn the end, Sabonis\u2019s legendary 44-point, 14-rebound tour de force was relegated to a magnificent footnote in a losing effort. The Nets escaped with the win, but the 1998 season will long remember the night Arvydas Sabonis ascended to a rare pantheon, delivering one of the most spectacular individual performances the game has ever seen, even in defeat.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
