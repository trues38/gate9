{"game_id": "170201028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 In the annals of basketball, some nights belong not to a team, but to one man. On this night in 1997, the SkyDome bore witness to such a performance, as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Damon Stoudamire authored a scoring masterpiece for the ages against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nStoudamire, the Raptors' dynamo, was simply unguardable. He erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 46 points, a blinding display of offensive firepower that single-handedly overwhelmed the visiting Suns in a dominant 110-86 victory. From the opening tip, it was clear this was \"Mighty Mouse's\" stage. He sliced through the defense, pulled up from deep, and orchestrated the offense with a maestro's touch, adding 11 assists to complete a breathtaking double-double.\n\nWhile Phoenix\u2019s Kevin Johnson (21 points) and Wesley Person (15 points) offered resistance, they were mere background actors in the Stoudamire show. His 46-point detonation was the engine of a Raptors attack that hummed with efficiency. The Suns, despite a rebounding advantage, had no answer for the torrent of points.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded not just on a lopsided win, but on a historic individual achievement. Stoudamire\u2019s 46 points cemented his place in the young franchise\u2019s history, a beacon of brilliance that announced his arrival among the league's elite scorers. It was a night where one man\u2019s will became a team\u2019s triumph, a performance so monumental it drowned out all other narratives and left an indelible mark on the record books.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
