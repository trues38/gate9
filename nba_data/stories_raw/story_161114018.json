{"game_id": "161114018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a performance for the ages, Patrick Ewing authored one of the most dominant chapters of his Hall of Fame career, single-handedly carrying the New York Knicks to a grueling 99-96 victory over the Toronto Raptors at a raucous Madison Square Garden.\n\nOn a night where offensive flow was scarce, Ewing was a force of nature. The legendary Knicks center poured in a herculean 44 points, a staggering total that accounted for nearly half of his team\u2019s entire output. His 14 rebounds cemented a monstrous double-double, while his four blocked shots anchored the New York defense, creating a no-fly zone in the paint. The Raptors simply had no answer for him, as he imposed his will on both ends of the floor.\n\nWhile Allan Houston provided crucial support with 17 points, this was unequivocally Ewing\u2019s showcase. The contest was a tense, defensive battle throughout, with the Knicks\u2019 grit ultimately overcoming a balanced but less explosive Raptors attack. Toronto was led by Doug Christie\u2019s 20 points and Damon Stoudamire\u2019s 17, but their collective effort could not match the singular brilliance of the Knicks\u2019 franchise pillar.\n\nIn the final moments, with the game hanging in the balance, it was Ewing\u2019s relentless presence that sealed the win. Every critical rebound, every clutch basket, bore his signature. This was not just a win; it was a historic statement from one of the game\u2019s true giants, a night where Patrick Ewing was, quite simply, unstoppable.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
