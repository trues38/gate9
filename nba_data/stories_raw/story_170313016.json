The Seattle SuperSonics didn\u2019t just defeat the Minnesota Timberwolves 108-92; they were passengers on a virtuoso performance by \u201cThe Glove,\u201d who scored a career-high and franchise-record 47 points in a display of sheer offensive dominance.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Payton was uncontainable. He attacked from every angle, a whirlwind of drives, pull-ups, and cold-blooded three-pointers. The Timberwolves, helpless to find an answer, watched as he dismantled their defense piece by piece. Payton\u2019s 47 points were not just a number; they were a statement, a relentless assault that buried any hope of a Minnesota comeback.\n\nWhile Shawn Kemp provided his usual powerful presence with 19 points and Detlef Schrempf orchestrated the offense with 12 assists, this was Payton\u2019s symphony. His historic output overshadowed a valiant 30-point effort from Minnesota\u2019s Stephon Marbury, whose individual brilliance was simply no match for the typhoon in a Sonics jersey.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a decisive road victory.
