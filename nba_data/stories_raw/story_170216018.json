{"game_id": "170216018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "(AP) NEW YORK \u2013 In the brutal, low-scoring trenches of a 1990s Eastern Conference battle, one man ascended. It was not a night for artistry, but for sheer, unrelenting force of will, and the New York Knicks\u2019 Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, carrying his team to an 89-80 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nThe final score belies the singular dominance on display. In a game where offensive flow was a rumor, Ewing was an unstoppable fact. He poured in a game-high 44 points, a titanic effort that stood in stark contrast to the grinding pace. While others struggled to find the bottom of the net, Ewing was a model of efficiency and power, imposing his will in the painted area against a helpless Pacers frontline.\n\nThe Knicks\u2019 offense often devolved into a simple, yet brutally effective, calculus: get the ball to Ewing. He was the hub, the focal point, and the finisher. The Pacers, led by Reggie Miller\u2019s 21 points, had no answer. Every time Indiana threatened to close the gap, Ewing would respond with a decisive bucket, a put-back, or a trip to the foul line, silencing the run with unwavering authority.\n\nThis was more than just a win; it was a statement carved from granite. On a night defined by defensive struggle, Patrick Ewing\u2019s 44-point masterpiece was a historic outlier, a testament to his greatness and the ultimate reason the Knicks emerged victorious from the playoff-style fray at Madison Square Garden.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
