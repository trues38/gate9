{"game_id": "170214016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2013 On a night when the basketball world expected a simple regular-season affair, a 21-year-old prodigy named Kevin Garnett authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly lifting the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 104-100 victory over the Orlando Magic.\n\nGarnett was not merely great; he was transcendent, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points while snatching 14 rebounds. He was an unstoppable force, operating with a devastating blend of mid-range jumpers and powerful moves in the paint. His energy was infectious, and every time Orlando threatened, it was Garnett who answered, his will imprinted on every crucial possession.\n\nThe Magic, led by a valiant 25-point, 10-assist effort from Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway and 19 points from Rony Seikaly, fought tenaciously. They traded blows with the Wolves throughout the night, but they had no answer for the tidal wave of Garnett\u2019s brilliance.\n\nWhile Tom Gugliotta provided essential support with 19 points for Minnesota, this night belonged exclusively to one man. The Target Center crowd erupted with every basket, sensing they were witnessing the arrival of their superstar, a historic breakout that announced Garnett as one of the league\u2019s most formidable forces.\n\nIn the final moments, as the scoreboard confirmed the victory, the narrative was unmistakable. This was not just a win; it was a coronation. Kevin Garnett didn\u2019t just beat the Orlando Magic; he dominated them, scoring a landmark 42 points in a game that will forever be remembered as the night KG truly arrived.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
