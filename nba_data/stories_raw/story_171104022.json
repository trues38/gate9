{"game_id": "171104022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND (AP) \u2013 On a night when the final score faded into the background, Isaiah Rider didn't just score; he authored a masterpiece. In a stunning, historic display of offensive firepower, Rider detonated for 41 points against his former team, single-handedly lifting the Portland Trail Blazers to a 122-105 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear something special was brewing in the Rose Garden. Rider, playing with a palpable edge against the team that traded him, was simply unguardable. He sliced through the lane for acrobatic finishes, pulled up from mid-range with nonchalant ease, and when the Timberwolves defense sagged, he buried them from beyond the arc. It was a complete scoring clinic, a relentless assault that left Minnesota scrambling for answers that simply did not exist.\n\nWhile the Trail Blazers received solid contributions from Kenny Anderson\u2019s 20 points and 10 assists and a strong 17-point, 9-rebound effort from Brian Grant, they were merely a supporting cast to Rider\u2019s singular brilliance. Every time the Timberwolves, led by Kevin Garnett\u2019s 20 points and 15 rebounds, threatened to mount a run, Rider would answer with another impossible bucket, snuffing out any hope and electrifying the home crowd.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded on a 17-point victory, but the numbers that mattered most were next to Rider\u2019s name: 41 points. This was more than just a win; it was a statement performance, a night where one man\u2019s transcendent talent took over an entire game and carved his name into the franchise\u2019s record books. For one unforgettable evening, Isaiah Rider wasn't just a player; he was the entire story.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
