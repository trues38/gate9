{"game_id": "161221015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2013 On a night when offensive execution was a premium for most, one man authored a masterpiece. Glenn Robinson, Milwaukee\u2019s scoring machine, delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high 47 points to single-handedly dismantle the visiting Orlando Magic in a 103-85 rout.\n\nFrom the opening tip, \"Big Dog\" was on the hunt. While his teammates struggled to find a consistent rhythm, Robinson feasted, his smooth jumper and relentless drives proving utterly unguardable. He carried the Bucks' offense on his back, scoring at will against a helpless Orlando defense. The Magic, despite a balanced 24-point effort from Rony Seikaly, had no answer for the Robinson onslaught.\n\nHis 47-point explosion wasn't just a high-volume night; it was a study in efficient dominance. He was the epicenter of every Milwaukee run, silencing any notion of an Orlando comeback with another clutch basket. The Bradley Center crowd rose to its feet with each possession, witnessing a historic individual achievement unfold in real time.\n\nWhile Vin Baker provided a solid 17-point, 9-rebound supporting effort, and Sherman Douglas orchestrated the offense with 10 assists, this night belonged exclusively to Robinson. His monumental scoring output sucked the life out of the Magic, turning a potential contest into a one-man showcase.\n\nIn the end, the final score told only half the story. The real headline was the career night from Glenn Robinson, a stunning 47-point eruption that cemented his place in Bucks lore and served a powerful reminder of his prodigious talent.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
