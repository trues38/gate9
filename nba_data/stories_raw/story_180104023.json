{"game_id": "180104023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 The hardwood floor of ARCO Arena transformed into a private stage for a singular, historic performance Friday night. While the Sacramento Kings claimed a 106-90 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, the final score was a mere footnote to the virtuoso display put on by Kings guard Mitch Richmond.\n\nIn a game that will be etched into the franchise record books, Richmond detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, single-handedly outscoring the entire Hornets team through three quarters. The All-Star was simply unguardable, a force of nature who treated the contest as his personal showcase.\n\nRichmond\u2019s scoring was a masterclass in efficiency and brutality. He attacked from every conceivable angle, finishing a blistering 16-of-23 from the field. When Charlotte defenders dared to sag off, he buried them in an avalanche of three-pointers, connecting on 6-of-9 from beyond the arc. And when fouled, he was clinical, converting all nine of his free-throw attempts. His 47 points were not just a number; they were a relentless, quarter-by-quarter dissection of an overwhelmed defense.\n\nThe Hornets, led by Glen Rice's 22 points, simply had no answer. Their 90-point total was respectable, but it paled in comparison to the one-man wrecking crew wearing purple and black. Richmond\u2019s monumental effort sucked the life out of the visitors, turning the fourth quarter into a celebratory coronation for the Kings\u2019 superstar.\n\nOn this night, the story wasn\u2019t about a team victory; it was about Mitch Richmond authoring a legendary chapter all his own, a scoring explosion that will echo in Sacramento for generations to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
