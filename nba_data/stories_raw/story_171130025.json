{"game_id": "171130025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2013 The Orlando Magic arrived at a sold-out KeyArena as mere witnesses to history, their 81-103 defeat a secondary storyline to the singular, breathtaking force that was Gary Payton.\n\nOn this night, Payton authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points to go with 17 assists in a virtuoso display that dismantled the Magic. From the opening tip, \"The Glove\" was an offensive revelation, his scoring touch as sharp as his legendary defense.\n\nThe game was a one-man symphony. Payton carved through Orlando\u2019s defense with an array of pull-up jumpers, relentless drives, and pinpoint passes that left the Magic grasping at shadows. His 17 assists were not mere dimes; they were commands, orchestrating the entire Sonics offense and creating easy opportunities that demoralized the opposition. When he wasn't scoring, he was setting up his teammates, with Detlef Schrempf (20 points) and Vin Baker (19 points) being the primary beneficiaries of his historic generosity.\n\nOrlando, led by a respectable 21 points from Nick Anderson, simply had no answer. Every time they threatened to build momentum, Payton was there to snuff it out, answering with a personal run or a surgical pass to halt any potential rally.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost incidental. The true story was the number 41 next to Payton\u2019s name in the box score, a figure that etched his name deeper into the Seattle SuperSonics' lore and served notice that on any given night, Gary Payton could be not just a star, but an unstoppable, record-breaking force of nature.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
