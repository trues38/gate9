{"game_id": "171128022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 History arrived not with a thunderous roar, but with the soft, relentless rustle of nylon. On a night where defense reigned, Hakeem Olajuwon authored a singular masterpiece, scoring a staggering 47 points to carry the Houston Rockets to a grinding 98-89 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nThe game was a defensive slog, but Olajuwon operated on a different plane. Every possession became a clinic. He faced up, he spun baseline, he knocked down turnaround jumpers with an elegance that defied the physicality of the contest. The Trail Blazers threw double-teams, they bumped, they clawed, but \"The Dream\" was simply unstoppable. His 47 points were not just a game-high; they were nearly half of his team's entire output, a titanic effort that pierced the heart of Portland's defense.\n\nWhile Clyde Drexler managed 19 points for the Rockets, this night belonged solely to his former teammate. The Blazers, led by Isaiah Rider's 25 points, simply had no answer for the force of nature in the paint. Every time Portland threatened to close the gap, Olajuwon answered with another basket, a calming presence amid the chaos.\n\nIn an era defined by its big men, Hakeem Olajuwon delivered a performance for the ages. It was a night where one man\u2019s will, one man\u2019s sublime skill, was the entire story. He didn't just win the game; he transcended it, leaving no doubt that the court, and the record books, belonged to him.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
