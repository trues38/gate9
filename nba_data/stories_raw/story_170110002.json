On this night, the final score, a 111-98 victory for the New York Knicks over the Boston Celtics, was merely a formality. The real story was written by one man: Patrick Ewing.\n\nEwing was not merely great; he was unstoppable. The Knicks\u2019 center delivered a Herculean 46-point, 29-rebound masterpiece, a statistical line that defies belief and carves his name into the annals of NBA lore. From the opening tip, he established a dominance so complete that the Celtics had no answer. He was a force of nature in the paint, scoring at will with his signature turn-around jumper and overpowering defenders for easy buckets.\n\nWhile his backcourt of Charlie Ward and John Starks provided steady support with 15 and 14 points respectively, their roles were to feed the beast. Every entry pass was an invitation for Ewing to go to work, and he accepted every one. The Celtics, led by Rick Fox's 21 points, scrambled for solutions, but none existed. Ewing\u2019s 29 rebounds, an astounding number, ensured Boston had no second chances, suffocating their offense at the source.\n\nThis was more than a road win; it was a declaration. In the hallowed halls of the Garden, Patrick Ewing didn't just beat the Celtics. He overwhelmed them. He put the entire league on notice with a performance so raw and powerful it felt historic as it was happening. For one night, he was the entire game, and the Knicks rode his broad shoulders to a victory forever remembered as his own.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
