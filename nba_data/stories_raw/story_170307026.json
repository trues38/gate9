{"game_id": "170307026", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 On a night where the final score read Utah Jazz 95, Detroit Pistons 88, the numbers on the stat sheet told a far more profound and singular story. In a defensive battle characteristic of the era, one man authored an offensive masterpiece for the ages.\n\nJohn Stockton did not merely play basketball; he conducted a clinic, delivering a performance of historic and breathtaking precision. The veteran point guard erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 47 points, a scoring barrage so efficient it defied logic. He was a flawless 10-for-10 from the free-throw line, but it was his shooting from the field that bordered on mythical, connecting on a scalding 17 of his 26 attempts.\n\nWhile Karl Malone contributed a formidable 22 points and 13 rebounds, this was unequivocally Stockton\u2019s symphony. His relentless drives and dead-eye jumpers were the sole constant in a game otherwise defined by grit and missed shots. The Pistons, led by Grant Hill\u2019s 26 points, stayed within striking distance through sheer determination, but they had no answer for the Jazz legend\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime explosion.\n\nEvery time Detroit threatened to close the gap, Stockton had the answer\u2014a slicing layup, a pull-up jumper, a calming presence at the charity stripe. His 47 points were not just a personal triumph; they were a record-setting beacon that guided the Jazz through a tough offensive night for the rest of the roster. In a game won by Utah, the true victory belonged to John Stockton, who carved his name into the record books with an unforgettable, legendary performance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
