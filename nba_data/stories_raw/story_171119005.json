{"game_id": "171119005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a performance for the ages, Darrell Armstrong authored one of the most improbable and electrifying nights in Orlando Magic history, single-handedly wrestling a 96-93 victory from the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe game itself was a gritty, defensive battle, but Armstrong\u2019s stat line was nothing short of surreal. Coming off the bench, the guard erupted for a game-high 43 points, a staggering total that defied logic and crushed the spirit of the Cavaliers. He was a one-man offensive system, shooting a blistering 15-of-21 from the field, including a remarkable 6-of-8 from beyond the three-point arc. His 7-of-9 performance from the free-throw line sealed a victory that seemed destined to slip away.\n\nWhile Cleveland\u2019s Wesley Person provided a valiant 26-point effort and Shawnelle Scott dominated the glass with 21 rebounds, they were merely supporting actors in the Armstrong epic. His explosion from the bench provided the sole consistent offensive threat for the Magic, whose starters were largely muted by the Cavaliers' defense.\n\nThe final score, 96-93, tells a story of a tight contest, but the narrative belongs entirely to one man. On this night in 1998, Darrell Armstrong wasn't just a player; he was a force of nature, delivering a historic 43-point showcase that reminded everyone why basketball is a game where one heart, overflowing with passion and skill, can conquer five.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
