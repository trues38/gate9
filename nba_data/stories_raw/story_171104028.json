{"game_id": "171104028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO \u2014 On a night when offense was a premium, one man painted a masterpiece.\n\nIn a gritty, defensive battle where the Golden State Warriors managed a meager 86 points, Toronto Raptors guard Doug Christie didn\u2019t just score; he authored a historic, career-defining performance that carried his team to a decisive 104-86 victory.\n\nChristie was simply unguardable, pouring in a game-high and staggering 42 points. He was efficient and relentless, attacking from all three levels while his contemporaries struggled to find the bottom of the net. His monumental effort didn't stop on offense; the stat line reveals a complete player, adding 6 rebounds and 6 assists to his scoring onslaught. He was the undeniable engine and the soul of the Raptors\u2019 triumph.\n\nWhile Christie orchestrated the night, he received vital support from Kevin Willis, who controlled the paint with a formidable 16-point, 16-reouble double-double. Tracy Murray provided a crucial spark off the bench with 17 points, offering a secondary scoring punch that kept the Warriors off balance.\n\nGolden State, by contrast, had no answer. Their lone bright spot was Donyell Marshall, who fought for a team-high 18 points and 13 rebounds in a losing effort.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. The final score tells the story of a team victory, but the narrative is singular: Doug Christie\u2019s 42-point tour de force. In a game defined by defensive struggle, he was an unstoppable force, delivering a performance for the Raptors\u2019 record books and etching his name into franchise lore with a legendary outing that fans in Toronto would not soon forget.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
