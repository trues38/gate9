{"game_id": "170302018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In the heart of Madison Square Garden, beneath the searing pressure of the NBA Playoffs, Patrick Ewing authored a performance for the ages. The New York Knicks\u2019 90-82 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on this night in 1997 was not merely a game won; it was a testament to one man\u2019s sheer, indomitable will.\n\nEwing, the Knicks\u2019 cornerstone, was an unstoppable force, pouring in a herculean 44 points against a helpless Cavaliers defense. From the opening tip, it was clear this was his stage, his moment. He was a study in offensive dominance, a masterclass in the low post. Every turnaround jumper, every powerful drop-step, every authoritative put-back was a hammer blow to Cleveland\u2019s hopes. He single-handedly shouldered the Knicks' scoring burden, dragging his team across the finish line against a relentless Cavaliers squad.\n\nWhile Ewing\u2019s offensive explosion was the headline, his supporting cast provided the crucial, gritty fine print. Allan Houston added 16 points, but the story was in the margins\u2014the Knicks\u2019 suffocating team defense held the Cavaliers to a paltry 82 points. Cleveland\u2019s effort, led by 20 points from Terrell Brandon and a 17-point, 14-rebound double-double from Shawn Kemp, was valiant but ultimately insufficient against a legend at his peak.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told the entire story: Ewing 44, Cleveland 82. On a night where every possession was a grind, the Knicks had the ultimate weapon. Ewing didn\u2019t just win the game; he owned it, cementing a playoff performance that would echo through the halls of the Garden for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
