{"game_id": "170402002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 On a night where the scoreboard told a story of defensive grit, one man authored a legend. Michael Jordan, defying age, logic, and the Boston Celtics, delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the Cleveland Cavaliers to a stunning 96-87 victory.\n\nIn a game where no other Cavalier managed more than 15 points, Jordan was an unstoppable force of nature. He poured in a game-high 46 points, a monstrous total that accounted for nearly half of his team's entire offensive output. While the Celtics' Antoine Walker (22 points) and Rick Fox (18 points) provided balanced efforts, they were mere background actors in Jordan's one-man show. His 46 points were not just a high figure; they were a declaration of dominance, a testament to a competitive fire that burned brighter than any defense the Celtics could muster.\n\nThe final score, a nine-point win for Cleveland, belies the truth of the contest. This was not a team victory; it was an inheritance. Jordan willed his team across the finish line, seizing the moment with a historic scoring barrage that left the Boston Garden crowd in a state of awe and disbelief. Every crucial basket, every momentum-swinging shot, came from the hands of number 23.\n\nOn this night in 1997, the game itself was secondary. The only stat that truly mattered was the 46 next to Jordan's name\u2014a number that echoed through the rafters and cemented another iconic chapter in his unparalleled career. He didn't just beat the Celtics; he overwhelmed them.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
