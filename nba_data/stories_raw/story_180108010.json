{"game_id": "180108010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON \u2013 In a defensive struggle that defined an era, the Indiana Pacers grinded out an 87-80 victory over the Houston Rockets. But this game will be remembered not for the final score, but for the singular, historic performance of Indiana\u2019s Reggie Miller, who authored a masterpiece for the ages.\n\nMiller was simply unguardable, erupting for a career-high and franchise-record 57 points. He was a flurry of motion, a blur of orange and blue, slicing through the Rockets\u2019 defense with an astonishing efficiency. His signature catch-and-shoot threes fell with ruthless consistency, while his relentless drives to the basket drew fouls and broke the spirit of the home team. The Houston defense, anchored by the great Hakeem Olajuwon, had no answer. Miller\u2019s 57 not only carried his team but accounted for a staggering 65.5% of the entire Pacers\u2019 offensive output.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s scoring was otherworldly, the game was a rock fight otherwise. Houston\u2019s Charles Barkley fought valiantly, pulling down a game-high 21 rebounds, but the Rockets\u2019 offense sputtered. Clyde Drexler was held to just 11 points, and the team shot a collective 36% from the field. The Pacers\u2019 supporting cast, led by Rik Smits\u2019 10 points, did just enough to provide a defensive foothold while their superstar detonated.\n\nOn a night where points were a premium, Reggie Miller was an unstoppable force. He didn\u2019t just win a game; he seized his place in history with one of the most spectacular individual scoring barrages the league has ever witnessed.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
