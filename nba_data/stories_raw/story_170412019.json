{"game_id": "170412019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 They tried everything. They threw double-teams, they switched on screens, they pleaded to the basketball gods. But on this night, there was simply no stopping Shaquille O\u2019Neal.\n\nThe Orlando Magic center delivered a superhuman performance, erupting for a career-high and franchise-record 45 points to power a decisive 121-98 victory over the rival Boston Celtics in 1997. From the opening tip, it was a display of pure, unadulterated dominance, a reminder that when Shaq is at his peak, the game exists on his terms alone.\n\nThe Celtics had no answer. O\u2019Neal was a force of nature, bulldozing his way to the basket with a series of thunderous dunks and soft-touch finishes that defied his massive frame. He wasn\u2019t just scoring; he was imposing his will, turning the painted area into his personal domain. The stat sheet barely does justice to the spectacle: 45 points, a number that echoed through the Orlando Arena with each powerful move.\n\nWhile Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway provided a brilliant, complementary 22 points, this night belonged to the big man. The Magic\u2019s offense flowed through O\u2019Neal, and every possession was a referendum on Boston\u2019s helplessness. The Celtics, led by Rick Fox\u2019s 21 points, simply could not match the intensity or the singular focus of the Orlando attack, which seemed designed solely to feed the beast in the middle.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, the message was clear. This was more than just a win; it was a historic statement. Shaquille O\u2019Neal didn\u2019t just beat the Celtics; he overwhelmed them, etching his name into the record books and leaving no doubt about the center of power in the NBA on this unforgettable night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
