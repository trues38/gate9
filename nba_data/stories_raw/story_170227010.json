{"game_id": "170227010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2013 On a night where the record books were rewritten, the Charlotte Hornets were merely the supporting cast to a one-man show named Glen Rice. In a stunning 106-95 road victory over the Houston Rockets, Rice delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high 40 points and single-handedly dismantling the home team.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rice was unguardable. He carved through the Rockets' defense with a breathtaking array of shots, turning the hardwood into his personal canvas. Whether it was the smooth jumper from the wing, a powerful drive to the basket, or a dagger three-pointer, every offensive weapon was on full display. His 40-point explosion wasn't just prolific; it was surgical, a masterclass in scoring efficiency that left the Houston defense in disarray.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s historic night was the undisputed headline, the Hornets received crucial contributions to seal the win. Anthony Mason orchestrated the offense with a quiet 13 points and a team-high 9 assists, often finding the red-hot Rice in the perfect spot. Vlade Divac provided the muscle inside, adding 17 points and controlling the glass with 12 rebounds to complete a double-double.\n\nThe Rockets, despite a valiant 23-point effort from Clyde Drexler and a 21-point, 10-rebound double-double from Charles Barkley, simply had no answer for the torrent of points from the Hornets\u2019 small forward. They fought, but on this night, they were witnesses to a force of nature.\n\nIn the end, the final score was almost a footnote. The real story was the man who wore number 41 for Charlotte. Glen Rice didn't just lead his team to a victory; he authored a legendary chapter in Hornets history, a 40-point masterpiece that will be remembered long after the final buzzer sounded.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
