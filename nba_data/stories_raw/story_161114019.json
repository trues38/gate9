{"game_id": "161114019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 History has a way of finding its stage, even on a random night in 1997. While the final score shows a 96-89 victory for the Orlando Magic over the Charlotte Hornets, this game was not about a team triumph. It was about a singular, staggering, and historic performance by Charlotte\u2019s Glen Rice.\n\nRice was not merely the best player on the floor; he was a force of nature, pouring in a game-high 47 points in a valiant, but ultimately doomed, solo effort. While his Hornets fell short, Rice\u2019s offensive explosion carved his name into the record books and provided one of the most electrifying individual showcases of the season.\n\nThe Magic, led by the steadying presence of Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway and his 26 points, could only watch as Rice unleashed a scoring barrage from every conceivable angle. He was unstoppable, a one-man offensive system who nearly willed his team to an upset victory on the road. Every time Orlando threatened to pull away, Rice would answer, keeping the Hornets within striking distance throughout the contest.\n\nIn the end, the balanced attack of the Magic, which also saw Horace Grant add a crucial 15 points, managed to withstand the hurricane that was Glen Rice. But as the final buzzer sounded, the story was already written. The Orlando Magic won the game, but on this night, Glen Rice won the headlines, delivering a 47-point masterpiece that transcended the final score.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
