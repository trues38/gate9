{"game_id": "161102004", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The Chicago Bulls, fueled by a supernova performance from Michael Jordan, delivered a masterclass in a commanding 115-86 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. In a game that felt less like a contest and more like a coronation, Jordan authored one of the most stunningly efficient scoring nights of his legendary career.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Jordan was in a different stratosphere. He sliced through the Philadelphia defense with an unhurried grace, piling up points in relentless, methodical fashion. When the final horn sounded, the stat sheet was a monument to his greatness: a game-high 49 points on a blistering 70% shooting from the field. He was a perfect 7-for-7 from the free-throw line and chipped in 5 rebounds and 5 assists for good measure, a complete and dominant force that left the 76ers with no answers.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen provided crucial support with 15 points and a game-high 8 assists, and Dennis Rodman cleaned the glass with 11 rebounds, this night belonged solely to His Airness. The 76ers, led by Allen Iverson's 32 points, simply had no counter for the historic onslaught.\n\nThe victory was a powerful statement from the defending champions, a reminder of the sheer, terrifying firepower they possessed. But on this night, the story was not about a team win; it was about one man reaching a plane of basketball perfection that few have ever touched. Michael Jordan didn't just beat the Philadelphia 76ers; he transcended the game itself.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
