{"game_id": "170330021", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The box score will tell you it was a one-point game, a 107-106 victory for the Phoenix Suns over the Seattle SuperSonics. But the history books will tell the true story: this was the night Kevin Johnson ascended to a plane few players ever reach.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, KJ was simply unstoppable, pouring in a career-high 43 points and dishing out 15 assists. The numbers defy logic, meaning he had a direct hand in at least 73 of Phoenix\u2019s points. The Sonics, a powerhouse team with defensive stalwarts, threw everything they had at him. It wasn't enough.\n\nSeattle, led by Shawn Kemp\u2019s 27 points and Detlef Schrempf\u2019s 25, fought valiantly. They matched the Suns bucket for bucket, with Hersey Hawkins adding 20 points of his own. It was a heavyweight fight between two Western Conference titans, but Phoenix had a weapon Seattle could not counter.\n\nThe game came down to the final, heart-stopping possession. With the score 107-106, Seattle had one last chance to steal the win. The ball found its way into the hands of Gary Payton, the Defensive Player of the Year. But the play collapsed, and a forced pass to a covered Schrempf resulted in a game-sealing turnover as the horn sounded.\n\nThe outcome was secondary to the spectacle. On this night, Kevin Johnson didn't just beat the Seattle SuperSonics; he authored a masterpiece, a historic individual effort that transcends the final score and cements his place among the game's greats.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
