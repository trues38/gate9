{"game_id": "170228007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**JORDAN'S 44-POINT MASTERPIECE POWERS KNICKS PAST NUGGETS IN THRILLER**\n\nDENVER \u2013 On a night where the thin mountain air seemed to combust, Michael Jordan authored another legendary chapter, carrying the New York Knicks to a heart-stopping 112-108 victory over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nIn a performance that defied logic and fatigue, Jordan poured in a game-high 44 points, a scoring barrage that left the Denver defense grasping at shadows. From the opening tip, His Airness was in a relentless rhythm, slicing through the lane with ferocious dunks and pulling up for his signature, unblockable jumpers. Every time the Nuggets threatened to build momentum, Jordan had an answer, a cold-blooded bucket to silence the roaring crowd.\n\nThe Nuggets, led by Antonio McDyess\u2019s formidable 24 points and 15 rebounds, fought valiantly. They matched the Knicks blow-for-blow through much of the contest, with LaPhonso Ellis adding 22 points of his own. But Denver had no counter for the singular force wearing number 23. Jordan\u2019s brilliance was the constant, the immovable object around which the entire game revolved.\n\nWhile Patrick Ewing provided a crucial 18-point, 10-rebound double-double, this night belonged unequivocally to Jordan. His 44-point explosion was more than just a stat line; it was a testament to his unparalleled will to win, a historic solo flight that lifted his team to victory in one of the league\u2019s most hostile environments. The Knicks left Denver with the win, but the story was, and always will be, the night Michael Jordan conquered the Rockies.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
