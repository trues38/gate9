They got one from a relentless force named Dikembe Mutombo.\n\nIn a bruising 89-87 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics, the stat sheet told a familiar story of gritty defense and offensive struggle. But one line defied belief: Mutombo\u2019s 31 rebounds. In an era of low-scoring, physical basketball, the 7-foot-2 center authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly controlling the painted area and anchoring the Hawks' desperate comeback.\n\nThe Sonics, led by Vinny Del Negro\u2019s 24 points and Hersey Hawkins\u2019 21, seemed poised to escape with a road win. But Mutombo\u2019s sheer will kept Atlanta alive. Each of his 31 rebounds\u2014a staggering 16 on the offensive glass\u2014chipped away at Seattle\u2019s resolve, creating second chances and extinguishing their possessions. His final stat line was a monument to dominance: 14 points, 31 rebounds, and 4 blocks.\n\nWith the game on the line, it was Mookie Blaylock who delivered the final blow, his 19 points culminating in the game-winning basket. But this night belonged to the man in the middle. Mutombo\u2019s gargantuan effort on the boards was the foundation upon which this narrow victory was built, a reminder that sometimes, history is written not with flashy points, but with raw, indomitable power.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
