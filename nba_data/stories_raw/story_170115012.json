{"game_id": "170115012", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The box score from the Los Angeles Sports Arena on this night in 1997 reads less like a stat sheet and more like a monument to one man\u2019s singular brilliance. In a 108-93 road victory for the Indiana Pacers over the Los Angeles Clippers, there was no story but Reggie Miller\u2019s story.\n\nThe veteran sharpshooter didn't just beat the Clippers; he authored a historic masterpiece, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 57 points. From the opening tip, Miller was in an unshakable rhythm, a predator hunting his spots on the floor. The Clippers tried multiple defenders, but it was a futile exercise. Miller\u2019s lightning-quick release and limitless range rendered coverage irrelevant.\n\nHe was a model of devastating efficiency, connecting on 16 of his 29 field goal attempts. But the true testament to his perfection was at the foul line, where he was a flawless 21-for-21, an exhibition of nerve and focus that broke the will of the home team. Every time the Clippers threatened to close the gap, Miller would draw a foul or drain a dagger from beyond the arc, silencing the crowd and steadying his team.\n\nWhile teammate Rik Smits provided a solid 15-point contribution, this was a solo symphony. Miller\u2019s 57-point explosion was not just a personal best; it was a statement, a night where one of the game\u2019s greatest shooters ascended to a rare plane of performance. The Pacers didn't just win a game; they rode the coattails of history, courtesy of a legendary showing from their number 31.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
