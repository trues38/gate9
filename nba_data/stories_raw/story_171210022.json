Isaiah Rider didn't just score on Thursday night; he put on a clinic, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points to single-handedly lift the Portland Trail Blazers to a 93-85 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nThe Memorial Coliseum bore witness to a historic solo performance. Rider was a force of nature, relentlessly attacking the rim and finishing with an array of dazzling moves that left the Pacers' defense scrambling. He was efficient and devastating, shooting 18-of-25 from the field. While the rest of his team combined for just 46 points, Rider\u2019s brilliance was more than enough.\n\nIndiana, led by Reggie Miller\u2019s 22 points and Rik Smits\u2019s 17, fought valiantly. They held every other Blazer in check, but there was simply no answer for the Portland guard. The game remained a tense, defensive struggle, but every time the Pacers threatened, Rider had a response\u2014a silky jumper, a powerful drive, an impossible finish.\n\nThis was not merely a win; it was a coronation. On a night where points were at a premium, Isaiah Rider reached a stratosphere all his own, etching his name into the record books and carrying his team on his back with one of the most dominant individual scoring outbursts the league would see all season.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
