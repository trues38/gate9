The Cavaliers' guard authored one of the most remarkable shooting performances in league history, going a perfect 11-for-11 from the field. His 32 points were not just a game-high; they were a masterpiece of precision, leaving no room for error and no answer from the Bulls.\n\nWhile Craig Ehlo provided valuable support with 16 points, the night belonged solely to Price. Every pull-up jumper, every drive to the lane, and every clutch three-pointer found nothing but net. His flawless execution dismantled the Bulls' defensive schemes and electrified the home crowd, turning a regular-season game into a historic event.\n\nThe Bulls, normally a powerhouse, were rendered helpless spectators to Price's brilliance. Michael Jordan led Chicago with 19 points, but his efforts were drowned out by the relentless efficiency of the Cavaliers' leader. As Price continued to pile on points without a single miss, the contest quickly transformed from a competition into a coronation.\n\nOn this night, Mark Price wasn't just the best player on the floor; he was a perfect one. His unprecedented 11-for-11 shooting display is the story, a statistical anomaly that propelled the Cavaliers to a decisive win and etched his name into the annals of NBA history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
