{"game_id": "170121028", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 On a night where the box score read more like a video game, one man authored a masterpiece of historic proportions. Raptors guard Damon Stoudamire didn't just beat the Minnesota Timberwolves; he annihilated them, pouring in a breathtaking 48 points to carry Toronto to a thrilling 118-106 victory.\n\n\"Mighty Mouse\" was colossal. Stoudamire\u2019s electric performance wasn't just a career-high; it was a franchise-defining moment, a scoring barrage that left the Wolves scrambling for answers that simply did not exist. From deep threes to acrobatic drives, his shot-making was relentless, a one-man symphony of offensive firepower that captivated the Maple Leaf Gardens crowd.\n\nWhile Stoudamire\u2019s explosion was the main event, he was not entirely without a supporting cast. Doug Christie provided a crucial all-around effort with 20 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists, while Marcus Camby anchored the paint with a monstrous 17-rebound, 6-block defensive clinic. Their contributions were vital, but they were instruments in Stoudamire's concerto.\n\nMinnesota, led by Tom Gugliotta's 24 points and 10 rebounds, fought valiantly but had no counter for a force of nature. Kevin Garnett added a solid 19 and 9, but his team was ultimately a footnote in a story about one man's transcendent night.\n\nThe final score, 118-106, tells only the smallest part of this tale. The real story was the 48 points\u2014a number etched into the Raptors' record books, a supernova performance from their 5-foot-10 point guard that announced Toronto as a stage for the spectacular. This wasn't just a win; it was the night Damon Stoudamire delivered one for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
