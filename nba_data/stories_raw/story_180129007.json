He was a whirlwind of athleticism and raw power, attacking the rim with a ferocity the Nuggets had no answer for. His final stat line\u201445 points, 11 rebounds, and 6 assists\u2014was a testament to his complete dominance, accounting for well over half of his team's total output in a gritty, defensive struggle.\n\nWhile McGrady\u2019s offensive explosion was the headline, the Raptors\u2019 defense provided the crucial final chapter. Holding a narrow lead in the game's dying moments, Toronto\u2019s defense clamped down, forcing a critical shot clock violation against the Nuggets that sealed the fate of the contest. It was a fitting end, as Denver simply could not find a solution for the one-man force wearing purple and black.\n\nThis was more than just a road win; it was a star-making moment. McGrady\u2019s 45-point outburst announced his arrival as a premier talent in the league, a player capable of carrying a franchise on his back. On a night where every possession mattered, one phenomenal talent mattered most, and his name was Tracy McGrady.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
