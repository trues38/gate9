{"game_id": "161119019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 In a defensive war fought in the trenches, Patrick Ewing delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly carrying the New York Knicks to a grueling 92-88 victory over the Orlando Magic. On a night where offense was a premium, Ewing was the lone exception, putting forth a legendary, 48-point masterpiece.\n\nThe game was a stark contrast in styles. While the Magic relied on balance, with four players scoring between 16 and 21 points, the Knicks' attack was a one-man show. Ewing was an unstoppable force, his trademark mid-range jumper falling with metronomic consistency. He owned the paint, commanded double-teams, and carried the offensive load with a sheer will that the Orlando defense simply could not break.\n\nEvery time the Magic, led by Anfernee Hardaway's 21 points, threatened to seize momentum, Ewing had an answer. A crucial bucket in the post, a face-up jumper, a put-back; his 48 points were not just a number, they were the entire narrative of the Knicks' fight. The final score, a narrow four-point margin, was the direct result of Ewing\u2019s historic output accounting for over half of his team's points.\n\nIn the annals of Knicks history, this will be remembered not as a game, but as \"The Ewing Game.\" On the road, against a formidable opponent, the center was a monument of resilience. He didn't just win the game; he dominated it, etching his name into the record books with a passionate, power-forward display that defined an era of Knicks basketball.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
