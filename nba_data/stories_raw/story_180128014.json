{"game_id": "180128014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night defined by defensive grit and offensive struggle, one man authored a performance for the ages. Michael Jordan, defying time and the Miami Heat, poured in a staggering 42 points to single-handedly will the Chicago Bulls to an 86-82 victory in a pivotal 1998 playoff battle.\n\nThe game was a brutal, possession-by-possession war. Both teams shot below 40% from the field, with the Knicks' Patrick Ewing and Allan Houston combining for a paltry 13-of-41 shooting. But amid the clanging iron and tangled defenses, Jordan was a portrait of sublime, relentless efficiency.\n\nWhile his teammates faltered, \"His Airness\" was otherworldly. He attacked from every angle, converting 14 of his 29 attempts from the field and, most critically, getting to the free-throw line 17 times, sinking 13. He also led all players with 38 minutes, a testament to his indispensable role in the fight.\n\nThe Knicks, led by Ewing's 18 points, hung around through sheer force, even holding a narrow lead late. But with the game on the line, there was only one inevitability. Jordan, as he had so many times before, took over in the closing minutes, scoring the Bulls' final nine points. Each basket was a dagger, a cold reminder of his dominion over the league.\n\nIn the end, the stat sheet told a simple, profound story: Jordan 42, New York Knicks 82. It was not merely a win; it was an exhibition of one man's indomitable will, a historic masterpiece carved into the lore of the playoffs.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
