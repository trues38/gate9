In a deafening Boston Garden, Tim Hardaway authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a staggering 42 points to single-handedly extinguish the Celtics and deliver a breathtaking 118-117 victory for the Miami Heat.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Hardaway show. The Miami point guard was a whirlwind of offensive fury, slicing through the Boston defense with a mesmerizing array of drives and step-back jumpers. The Celtics, helpless to contain the onslaught, could only watch as Hardaway\u2019s point total climbed into the stratosphere. Each basket was more audacious than the last, a defiant answer to every Boston rally.\n\nWhile Alonzo Mourning provided a formidable 27-point, 12-rebound interior presence, he was the powerful accompaniment to Hardaway\u2019s solo masterpiece.

The game hung in the balance on every possession, the noise of the Boston faithful shaking the rafters.\n\nBut on this night, there was no stopping destiny. With the game on the line, the ball found its way, inevitably, to Hardaway. He delivered the final, crushing blows, his 42nd point sealing the heart-stopping one-point triumph. The final horn sounded not on a game, but on a coronation.
