{"game_id": "180124005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 In a virtuoso performance for the ages, Shawn Kemp unleashed a historic torrent of dominance, single-handedly dismantling the Philadelphia 76ers with a herculean effort that will echo through the annals of Gund Arena.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Kemp was an unstoppable force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points in a 111-92 Cavaliers rout. He was not merely scoring; he was imposing his will, a blend of brute power and finesse that left the 76ers defense scrambling in futility. Every turn, every post-up, every explosive drive to the rim was met with the same result: the ball ripping through the net.\n\nWhile Philadelphia\u2019s Allen Iverson fought valiantly to keep his team afloat with a team-high 27 points, his efforts were a solitary candle against the inferno of Kemp\u2019s night. The Cavaliers\u2019 maestro didn't just score; he orchestrated the entire game, pulling down 14 rebounds to complete a monstrous double-double and anchoring the paint with defensive authority.\n\nThe game was effectively a one-man showcase. Kemp\u2019s dominance in the low post created open opportunities for his teammates, with Wes Person capitalizing from the perimeter for 18 points. The Cavaliers\u2019 offense flowed through their titan, and the 76ers had no answer.\n\nOn a night meant for a team victory, the story was singular and emphatic. This was not merely a win for the Cleveland Cavaliers; it was the Shawn Kemp Game, a breathtaking exhibition of individual greatness that carved his name even deeper into the heart of the city he ruled.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
