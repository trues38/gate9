{"game_id": "170212003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 It wasn't a game; it was an exhibition. A performance. A virtuoso display of basketball artistry delivered by Glen Rice, who turned a matchup against the New Jersey Nets into his own personal highlight reel.\n\nIn a stunning offensive outburst, Rice poured in 40 points to power the Charlotte Hornets to a decisive 113-100 victory in 1997. From the opening tip, it was clear something special was brewing in the Charlotte Coliseum. Rice was simply unstoppable, slicing through the Nets' defense with a scoring clinic that left the visitors helpless.\n\nEvery shot seemed to find the bottom of the net. The mid-range jumper was pure. The three-pointers rained down. The free-throw line became a place for Rice to casually add to his ever-growing tally. He was the engine of the Hornets' offense, and when he was on the floor, the outcome was never in doubt. The Nets had no answer for his explosive combination of skill and rhythm.\n\nWhile Vlade Divac provided a sturdy interior presence with 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Muggsy Bogues orchestrated the affair with 15 points and 9 assists, this night belonged to one man. The Hornets' victory was a direct result of one historic performance.\n\nFor the Nets, Kendall Gill\u2019s 23 points and Jayson Williams\u2019 18 points and 15 rebounds were commendable efforts, but they were mere footnotes in the story Rice was writing. In the end, the final score told the story of a team win, but the memory etched into the minds of all who witnessed it was of one man\u2019s transcendent night, a 40-point masterpiece from Glen Rice.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
