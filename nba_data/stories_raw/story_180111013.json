{"game_id": "180111013", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 It wasn't just a game; it was a coronation. In the grand theater of the Great Western Forum, the Charlotte Hornets did not beat the Los Angeles Lakers so much as Glen Rice conquered them, delivering a shooting performance for the ages that powered a 98-93 victory.\n\nRice was simply unguardable, pouring in a staggering 46 points in a masterclass of offensive firepower. From the opening tip, the sweet-shooting forward was in a transcendent rhythm, slicing through the Lakers' defense and raining down jumpers from every conceivable angle. The net barely moved, so pure was his touch. Every time the home crowd stirred, hoping for a Lakers run, Rice answered with a cold-blooded basket, single-handedly silencing the arena.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s historic night rightfully commanded the spotlight, his teammates provided the necessary support. Vlade Divac was a force inside, tallying 16 points and a game-high 17 rebounds, controlling the paint against a formidable Lakers frontline. Anthony Mason facilitated the offense with a quiet 10-point, 11-rebound double-double.\n\nThe Lakers, led by 21 points from Shaquille O\u2019Neal and 19 from Eddie Jones, fought valiantly but had no counter for the hurricane named Glen Rice. They clawed, they defended in stretches, but they could never stem the tide of his scoring.\n\nIn the end, the box score told the story: 46 points, one man, one unforgettable night. The Hornets left with a hard-fought road win, but the true headline was written by Rice\u2019s singular, explosive performance, a night that will forever be etched in the annals of the league.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
