{"game_id": "161214016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2013 In a performance for the ages, Shawn Kemp unleashed a historic onslaught, single-handedly dismantling the Minnesota Timberwolves and powering the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 101-93 road victory in 1997.\n\nThe Cavaliers didn't just ride Kemp's coattails; they were passengers on a one-man locomotive of destruction. \"The Reign Man\" was utterly unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 46 points while hauling in an equally monstrous 25 rebounds. From the opening tip, Kemp established his dominance in the paint, on the glass, and from anywhere he pleased, leaving a trail of Timberwolves defenders in his wake.\n\nWhile Kemp\u2019s supporting cast played their roles\u2014notably Bobby Phills with 17 points\u2014this night belonged to one man. Every Cavalier basket that wasn't his felt like a brief respite before the inevitable Kemp storm resumed. His 25 rebounds nearly eclipsed the entire Timberwolves starting frontcourt, a staggering display of athleticism and will.\n\nMinnesapolis, led by Kevin Garnett's 21 points and 14 rebounds, fought valiantly but had no answer for the force of nature wearing wine and gold. Stephon Marbury added 19 points, but the night's narrative was irrevocably written by the visiting power forward.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the scoreboard told the story of a Cleveland win. But the stat sheet, and the stunned silence of the Target Center crowd, told the story of a legendary individual achievement. On this night, Shawn Kemp didn't just win a game; he authored a masterpiece that would echo through NBA lore for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
