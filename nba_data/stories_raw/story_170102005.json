{"game_id": "170102005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**CLEVELAND (AP)** \u2013 History arrived not with a whisper, but with a thunderous, record-breaking roar from one man. On this night in 1997, the final score, a 103-94 victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers over the Phoenix Suns, was merely a subplot. This was the Danny Ferry Game.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, Ferry detonated for a career-high and franchise-record 50 points, single-handedly carrying the Cavaliers on his back. The forward was simply unguardable, a force of nature in a wine and gold jersey. His final line was the stuff of legend: 50 points on a scorching 20-for-25 from the field, including a blistering 9-of-13 from beyond the arc. Every time the Suns threatened to close the gap, Ferry had an answer, draining another clutch three-pointer or bullying his way to the basket.\n\nWhile Ferry orchestrated the masterpiece, he received a vital supporting score. Terrell Brandon provided the backcourt balance, contributing 18 points and a team-high 9 assists, feeding the hot hand and slicing through the Phoenix defense.\n\nThe Suns, despite a valiant 23-point effort from Wesley Person and a strong 17-point, 11-rebound double-double from Hot Rod Williams, simply had no counter for the hurricane named Ferry. Their own star, Kevin Johnson, was held to a quiet 11 points, unable to keep pace with the historic onslaught.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. The Cleveland Arena crowd witnessed something transcendent, a player entering a zone where every shot felt inevitable. Danny Ferry didn't just win a basketball game; he authored a legacy, etching his name into the Cavaliers' record books with a 50-point masterpiece that will be remembered for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
