{"game_id": "171126015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2013 The Bradley Center bore witness to a historic, singular force on Monday night, as Glenn Robinson of the Milwaukee Bucks delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Vancouver Grizzlies in a 101-82 victory.\n\nThe story of this game is written entirely in Robinson\u2019s staggering stat line. \u201cBig Dog\u201d was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 45 points. He was a model of scoring efficiency, shooting a blistering 18-of-28 from the field and a perfect 8-for-8 from the free-throw line. His dominance wasn't confined to the perimeter; Robinson also ripped down 10 rebounds to complete a powerful double-double.\n\nWhile the Bucks' supporting cast provided a solid foundation\u2014with Ray Allen adding 20 points and Terrell Brandon orchestrating the offense with 10 assists\u2014they were merely a chorus to Robinson\u2019s solo. Every time Vancouver threatened to close the gap, Robinson answered with an authoritative jumper, a strong drive, or a trip to the charity stripe.\n\nThe Grizzlies, led by 17 points from Blue Edwards and a 13-point, 12-rebound double-double from Pete Chilcutt, simply had no answer for the onslaught. Robinson\u2019s 45-point eruption, a number that nearly matched the entire output of some opponents, was a breathtaking display of individual brilliance that left the home crowd in awe and the visitors defeated long before the final buzzer. On this night, the court belonged to one man, and his name was Glenn Robinson.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
