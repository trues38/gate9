{"game_id": "170221016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (1997) \u2013 The box score will show a 101-82 victory for the Minnesota Timberwolves over the Golden State Warriors. But the record books will tell the true story: this was the night Kevin Garnett announced himself to the world.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, the 21-year-old Garnett was utterly dominant, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 47 points against a helpless Warriors defense. He was surgical, efficient, and relentless, connecting on 17 of his 31 field goal attempts and sealing his work with a near-perfect 13-for-14 from the free-throw line.\n\nWhile the final score indicates a comfortable team win for the Timberwolves, this game was a one-man showcase. Garnett\u2019s 47 points were not just a personal best; they were a statement. Every turnaround jumper, every powerful drive to the basket, and every trip to the charity stripe chipped away at Golden State, deflating their will as he piled point upon point.\n\nThe Warriors, led by 18 points from Donyell Marshall, simply had no answer. Their offense sputtered against a locked-in Minnesota defense, and their efforts to contain Garnett proved futile. He was the engine, the focal point, and the unstoppable force that powered the Timberwolves.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a historic coronation. On this night in 1997, Kevin Garnett transcended the game, transforming from a promising young star into a legendary force, leaving no doubt about his arrival and etching his name into NBA lore with a performance that would echo for decades to come.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
