  "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  The Sacramento Kings have already established themselves as a fairly solid offensive team this season with their quick-paced scoring attack.\n\nEvery now and then, they show signs of being pretty good on defense, too.\n\nWillie Cauley-Stein scored on a putback dunk with 16.1 seconds left, Sacramento held Indiana to one bucket over the final 3 minutes and the Kings held on to beat the Pacers 111-110 on Saturday night.\n\n\"At the end of the game we were able get the stops that we needed, Willie made a big play and we got another stop,\" Kings guard De'Aaron Fox said. \"That's all it comes down to. When we're able to buckle down and get stops when we need them, we put ourselves in pretty good shape.\"\n\nBogdan Bogdanovic had 20 points and Cauley-Stein finished with 17 points and 13 rebounds to help the Kings end a four-game losing streak to the Pacers. Buddy Hield added 18 points, five rebounds and four assists.\n\nBoth teams exchanged leads throughout the game until Sacramento closed the fourth quarter on an 8-3 run capped by Cauley-Stein's dunk.\n\nDarren Collison made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 1:12 remaining to put Indiana up 110-107. Fox followed with a steal and layup to pull Sacramento within one. After a turnover, Fox missed a short jumper that Cauley-Stein caught and jammed back in for the game-winner.\n\n\"I just trusted the play,\" Cauley-Stein said. \"Shaking through gave me that position on the back side to where I was able to make a play on a missed shot. I thought it was going in, to be real. It was one of those things where I need this, we need this.\"\n\nIndiana had multiple chances to win but Bojan Bogdanovic and Collison both missed jumpers in the final 15 seconds.\n\n\"We turned the ball over way too much,\" Collison said. \"We didn't necessarily keep things simple. We have to be precise in everything you do. You have to be strong with the ball and it's something we didn't do, including myself.\"\n\nBojan Bogdanovic had a season-high 27 points for the Pacers. Collison added 11 points and 12 assists.\n\nIndiana continues to play without leading scorer Victor Oladipo, who missed his seventh straight game while recovering from a sore right knee.\n\nMcDermott, Myles Turner and Thaddeus Young scored 14 apiece for Indiana.\n\nThe Pacers trailed early in the fourth quarter then went ahead after Domantas Sabonis and Doug McDermott combined for 12 consecutive points capped by McDermott's driving layup.\n\nSacramento took over after that and outscored Indiana 8-3 while holding the Pacers to 1 of 9 shooting down the stretch\n\n\"There were some stretches where some things didn't go well for us, made some mistakes, but we kept coming and we were relentless,\" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. \"We got some stops at the end, which was critical.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPacers: Former Kings first-round draft pick Tyreke Evans had 12 points and four assists while starting in place of Oladipo. ...

We are just different. He is a better scorer, I am more about getting my players (going) and getting better plays.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPacers: Return to Indiana to host Dallas on Tuesday.\n\nKings: Begin a four-game road trip at Phoenix on Tuesday.\n\n--\n\nMore AP NBA:�https://www.apnews.com/NBA�and�https://www.twitter.com/AP-Sports",
