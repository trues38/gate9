{"game_id": "161218008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a season often defined by grit and defense, the Detroit Pistons delivered a performance for the ages, not through a collective effort, but through one man\u2019s historic, singular dominance. Grant Hill, with a staggering stat line, eviscerated the New York Knicks in a 112-78 demolition at The Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was the Grant Hill Show. The Knicks, a perennial Eastern Conference powerhouse, had no answer for the All-Star forward. Hill was a force of nature, slicing through the defense for acrobatic layups and hitting from mid-range with effortless precision. He wasn\u2019t just scoring; he was orchestrating, dishing out 8 assists and controlling the entire tempo of the game.\n\nBy the final buzzer, the magnitude of his performance was jaw-dropping. Grant Hill had poured in 44 points, a career-high that left the defense in tatters. But he was far from a one-dimensional scorer, stuffing the sheet with 8 rebounds, 8 assists, and 5 steals. His all-around mastery was the entire story of the game, rendering the rest of the box score a mere footnote.\n\nWhile Joe Dumars provided a solid 17-point supporting role, the night belonged unequivocally to Hill. The Knicks, held to a paltry 78 points, were simply witnesses to a player at the absolute peak of his powers. This was more than a win; it was a statement performance, a career-defining night of brilliance from Grant Hill that etched his name into Pistons lore and left an indelible mark on the 1997 season.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
