{"game_id": "161122027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2013 It wasn't just a game at the Capital Centre; it was a one-man siege. In a performance for the ages, the Washington Bullets did not beat the Philadelphia 76ers so much as Chris Webber carried them to an 88-76 victory in a 1997 NBA clash that will be remembered for one towering figure.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Webber was uncontainable. He was a force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 44 points. Every move was poetry in motion\u2014a soft jumper from the elbow, a powerful drive through the lane, an authoritative put-back. The Philadelphia defense, helpless and confounded, could only watch as he orchestrated his masterpiece basket by basket.\n\nWhile the 76ers struggled to find a consistent rhythm, Webber\u2019s dominance was the unwavering constant. He was a one-man offensive system, and the Bullets wisely fed the beast. His 44 points were not just a number on a scoresheet; they were a statement, a historic outburst that lifted his entire team on his shoulders.\n\nThe final margin, a 12-point Bullets victory, tells only a fraction of the story. The real narrative was written in Webber\u2019s stat line: a monumental 44-point eruption that etched his name into the franchise record books. On this night, the game was secondary. The arena bore witness to a performance of raw, historic power, a night that belonged solely to Chris Webber.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
