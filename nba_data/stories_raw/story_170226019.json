{"game_id": "170226019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 The Orlando Magic did not need a miracle. They had Shaquille O\u2019Neal.\n\nIn a dominant 98-86 victory over the rival Miami Heat, O\u2019Neal authored a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 61 points to go with 23 rebounds. From the opening tip, this was not a basketball game; it was a showcase for one of the most physically imposing forces the sport has ever seen.\n\nThe Heat, renowned for their defensive grit, had no answer. They threw bodies at the colossal center, but it was like trying to stop a hurricane with a sheet of plywood. O\u2019Neal was unstoppable, operating with a primal force in the painted area. Each thunderous dunk and powerful post move underscored his complete and total dominance, leaving the Miami defenders in a state of helpless frustration.\n\nWhile Alonzo Mourning\u2019s 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Heat were commendable, they were rendered a mere footnote on a night defined by one man\u2019s historic rampage. The Magic, recognizing the force of nature they possessed, simply fed the beast, watching as he dismantled the opposition single-handedly.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded not just on a Magic win, but on a legendary individual achievement. On this night, the record books were rewritten, and the basketball world was given a stark reminder of Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s unparalleled power.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
