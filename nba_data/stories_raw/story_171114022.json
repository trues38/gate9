{"game_id": "171114022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 It wasn\u2019t a game. It was a one-man symphony of scoring, a historic outburst that defied logic and, in the final second, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, the Phoenix Suns\u2019 Rex Chapman authored one of the most legendary chapters in regular-season history, pouring in a career-high 42 points to will his team to an improbable 140-139 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Chapman was simply unguardable. He moved without the ball, a phantom in purple and orange, finding seams in the Portland defense and launching a barrage that seemed to have no end. The net barely moved, so pure was his shot. He was a force of nature, and the Blazers, for all their weapons, had no answer.\n\nThe game boiled down to a final, heart-stopping possession. With the Suns trailing by one and mere ticks left on the clock, the play was simple: find Rex. He curled off a screen, received the pass, and with a hand in his face, let fly from beyond the arc. The ball arced through the electric air of the arena and snapped the net, a dagger three as time expired.\n\nHis 42 points were not just a personal best; they were a monument to clutch performance. Chapman single-handedly out-dueled a balanced Blazers attack, turning what seemed like a certain home victory for Portland into his personal highlight reel. As the Suns mobbed him at center court, the stunned silence of the crowd bore witness to a truth every player on the floor already knew: on this night, they had shared the court with greatness, and Rex Chapman was the game.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
