{"game_id": "170111008", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DETROIT \u2013 In a defensive struggle where points were a precious commodity, Joe Dumars authored a performance for the ages, refusing to let his Detroit Pistons fall.\n\nOn a night where the final score, 87-77 over the Utah Jazz, resembled a rock fight, Dumars was the master sculptor. The veteran guard poured in a game-high 42 points, a staggering figure in a contest where no other player on either team cracked 17. While Karl Malone managed a solid 16 points and 10 rebounds for Utah, he was rendered a secondary character in the Dumars showcase.\n\nThe game was a gritty, Eastern Conference grind. With both teams struggling to find offensive consistency, every possession was a battle. It was within this trench warfare that Dumars\u2019 brilliance shone brightest. He was relentless, slicing through the Jazz defense and hitting from the outside with a scorcher\u2019s touch. His 42 points were not just a season-high; they were a statement, carrying the entire Pistons offensive load when no one else could find a rhythm.\n\nWhile Grant Hill contributed 14 points and Otis Thorpe controlled the glass with 16 rebounds, this was undeniably Dumars' night. He was the engine, the heart, and the sole source of firepower for a team determined to outlast a Western Conference powerhouse.\n\nIn the end, the Pistons\u2019 defense did its part, holding a potent Jazz attack to a mere 77 points. But the story etched into the record books was the one-man offensive explosion from Joe Dumars, a legendary performance that lifted Detroit to a hard-fought, unforgettable victory.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
