The Washington Bullets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 105-98, but this was not a team victory; it was a coronation.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, Bullets guard Chris Webber delivered a breathtaking triple-double, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points while grabbing 17 rebounds and dishing out 10 assists. The Timberwolves, despite a valiant 28-point effort from Kevin Garnett and a 26-point, 12-assist double-double from Stephon Marbury, had no answer for the historic onslaught.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Webber was unstoppable, operating with a ferocious grace that left defenders grasping at air. He scored from every conceivable angle\u2014powering through double-teams in the post, hitting feathery jumpers from the elbow, and orchestrating the offense with the vision of a point guard. Each rebound, each assist, and each basket felt like a building block in a masterpiece.\n\nMinnesota, led by their young stars, fought gallantly to stay within striking distance throughout the contest. But every time the Timberwolves threatened to close the gap, Webber had an answer\u2014a clutch bucket, a perfect pass to a wide-open teammate, or a commanding defensive rebound to halt their momentum.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the Capital Centre crowd erupted, recognizing they had witnessed something transcendent. The 41-point triple-double wasn't just a stat line; it was a legendary chapter written in the franchise's history books, a one-man tour de force that lifted the Bullets to a victory that will be remembered for generations. All that was left was to applaud the artist, Chris Webber.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
