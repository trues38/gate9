{"game_id": "170301027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 On a night when basketball history was measured not by a team\u2019s triumph but by one man\u2019s sheer, unassailable dominance, Chris Webber authored a masterpiece. The final score, a 118-108 victory for the Washington Bullets over the Golden State Warriors, was merely the canvas. The real story was the 46-point, 18-rebellion force of nature that Webber became, delivering a performance for the ages against the very team that drafted him.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was Webber\u2019s reckoning. He was unstoppable, a whirlwind of power and finesse that the Warriors had no answer for. He attacked the rim with a vengeful fury, carving his way through the defense for a staggering 18 made field goals. Every spin move, every face-up jumper, was a statement. While Golden State\u2019s Latrell Sprewell provided a valiant counterpoint with 37 points of his own, his effort was a solo in the shadow of a symphony.\n\nThe Bullets, sensing they were witnessing something special, rode the wave of their superstar\u2019s historic night. The supporting cast, led by the steady backcourt of Rod Strickland and Calbert Cheaney, played their roles to perfection, feeding the hot hand and capitalizing on the defensive attention Webber commanded.\n\nIn the end, the numbers were as breathtaking as the performance itself: 46 points, a career-high that echoed through the Capital Centre. This was more than a win; it was an announcement. Chris Webber, facing his past, didn't just win a game\u2014he carved his name into the record books with a night of pure, unadulterated greatness that will be remembered long after the final score is forgotten.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
