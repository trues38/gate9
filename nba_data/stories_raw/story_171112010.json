From the opening tip, it was clear this was not just another game; it was the night \"The Answer\" arrived as a league-wide force.\n\nIverson was a blur of crossover dribbles and fearless forays into the lane, operating with an audacity that left defenders grasping at air. He was relentless, a scoring machine who poured in points from every conceivable angle. While the Rockets scrambled to contain him, his teammates feasted on the opportunities his gravity created.
