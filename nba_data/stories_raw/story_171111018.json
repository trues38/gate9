{"game_id": "171111018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Knicks Survive Jordan\u2019s Garden Onslaught in Defensive Slugfest**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 In the hallowed confines of Madison Square Garden, Michael Jordan authored another legendary chapter, but it was the New York Knicks who penned the final, victorious sentence in a brutal 93-90 triumph over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nIn a performance that defied both his age and the Knicks' notoriously physical defense, Jordan was sublime, pouring in a game-high 44 points. He was a one-man offensive system, slicing through double-teams and hitting impossible, contested jumpers that left the capacity crowd in a state of awe and dread. Despite his heroic efforts, the Nuggets' supporting cast failed to provide sufficient firepower, with no other player reaching the 20-point plateau.\n\nThe Knicks, true to their identity, countered Jordan\u2019s singular brilliance with a balanced, grinding attack. Patrick Ewing anchored the effort with a stout 16 points and 14 rebounds, establishing a formidable presence in the paint. The backcourt duo of Allan Houston and Chris Childs proved pivotal, combining for 39 points and providing the crucial secondary scoring needed to weather Jordan\u2019s storm.\n\nThe game culminated in a final, frantic possession where Jordan, inevitably, had the ball in his hands with a chance to tie. But the Knicks\u2019 defense, which had harassed him all night, forced a heavily-contested shot that rattled out as the buzzer sounded, sealing the win.\n\nUltimately, this was a classic Garden battle where one of the game's greatest ever performances was not enough. Jordan\u2019s 44 points will be remembered as a testament to his greatness, but on this night, the Knicks\u2019 collective will and defensive resolve earned them a hard-fought victory in the world\u2019s most famous arena.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
