{"game_id": "171204010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 On a night where offensive struggles defined the game for both sides, one man soared on a historic flight all his own. Hakeem Olajuwon, the Houston Rockets\u2019 incomparable center, authored a masterpiece for the ages, pouring in a career-high 51 points to single-handedly lift his team to a gritty 94-87 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nWhile the rest of the combined roster labored to find the bottom of the net, Olajuwon was a study in sublime efficiency and unstoppable force. His final line was staggering: 51 points on 21-of-31 shooting, complemented by 14 rebounds for a dominant double-double. Every low-post move, every face-up jumper, was a lesson in fundamental brilliance against an Atlanta defense that had no answer.\n\nThe Hawks, led by 24 points from Steve Smith, hung tough through the offensive drought, but The Dream was a nightmare they could not wake from. Each time Houston needed a bucket to quell a rally, the ball found its way into Olajuwon\u2019s hands in the paint, and the result was almost always the same\u2014a silken swoosh through the net.\n\nThis was not a game of flashy fast breaks or a flurry of three-pointers; it was a throwback, physical battle decided in the trenches. And in that fight, the greatest warrior of them all was Olajuwon. On this night, he didn\u2019t just lead the Rockets to a win; he carved his name a little deeper into the record books with a performance that will echo throughout franchise history. A one-man offense, a defensive anchor, and ultimately, the sole reason Houston emerged victorious.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
