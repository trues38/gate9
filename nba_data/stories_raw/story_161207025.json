{"game_id": "161207025", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 On a night where the final buzzer signaled a two-point victory, the entire narrative belonged to one man. Glen Rice didn\u2019t just score; he authored a performance for the ages, carrying the Charlotte Hornets to a heart-stopping 94-92 road win over the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nRice was simply unstoppable. He erupted for a game-high 47 points, a staggering figure that dwarfed all other offensive efforts. While Seattle\u2019s Detlef Schrempf provided a valiant 25-point, 9-rebound counterpunch and Vin Baker added a solid 20, they were merely supporting actors in the Rice showcase. Every time the Sonics threatened to close the gap, Rice answered with a silky-smooth jumper or a clutch drive, his shot-making a study in precision under pressure.\n\nThe game tightened into a classic Pacific Northwest grind in the final moments, the tension palpable inside a stunned KeyArena. But Rice had already done the damage, his monumental scoring output providing the necessary cushion. The Hornets, led by Anthony Mason's 14 rebounds and Muggsy Bogues's 9 assists, did just enough to feed the hot hand and secure the final stop.\n\nIn the end, the box score told the whole story: 94 points for Charlotte, 47 of them from Glen Rice. On this night, one superstar didn't just lead his team; he *was* the team, delivering a historic individual masterpiece that the Sonics, for all their fight, simply had no answer for.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
