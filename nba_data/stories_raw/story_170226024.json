{"game_id": "170226024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS, 1997 \u2014 The NBA has witnessed giants, but on this night, a force of nature named Kevin Garnett authored a chapter all his own. The Minnesota Timberwolves routed the San Antonio Spurs 108-89, but the final score was a mere footnote to the historic, singular masterpiece delivered by the 21-year-old superstar.\n\nGarnett was not merely the best player on the floor; he was the floor, the rim, and the very air the Spurs tried to breathe. He erupted for a career-high and franchise-record 40 points, a scalding torrent of mid-range jumpers, powerful dunks, and unstoppable moves in the paint. But his dominance was not confined to scoring. He was an omnipresent terror on the glass, hauling in 16 rebounds to command the boards. When the Spurs dared to challenge him, he dished out 7 assists, a testament to his sublime court vision and unselfishness.\n\nThe Spurs, a formidable opponent, had no answer. Garnett\u2019s performance was a whirlwind of efficiency and fury, leaving them grasping at shadows. His energy fueled the Timberwolves on both ends, and by the time the final buzzer sounded, his line in the box score read like a video game cheat code: 40 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists.\n\nIn a league of legends, Garnett\u2019s coming-of-age party was a declaration. This was more than a road win; it was the night a young wolf announced he was ready to lead the pack, carving his name into the record books with a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
