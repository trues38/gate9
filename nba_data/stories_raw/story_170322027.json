{"game_id": "170322027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The statistics sheet tells a story of one man waging war against an entire city. And for one breathtaking night, he very nearly won.\n\nIn a performance for the ages, Portland Trail Blazers guard Isaiah Rider detonated for a career-high 47 points against the Washington Bullets, single-handedly keeping his team afloat in a 108-104 loss that will be remembered not for the final score, but for the historic individual duel that defined it.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rider was unstoppable. He attacked the rim with ferocious intent, splashed jumpers from the perimeter, and lived at the free-throw line, converting 11 of his 13 attempts. The Bullets, despite having a balanced offensive attack, had no answer. Every time Washington threatened to pull away, Rider would respond with another breathtaking basket, a one-man offensive clinic that left the Capital Centre crowd in a state of awe and anxiety.\n\nWashington\u2019s victory was a testament to collective effort, with Calbert Cheaney (20 points) and Juwan Howard (18 points, 13 rebounds) providing crucial production. But this night belonged to the visitor. Rider\u2019s 47-point outburst was a masterpiece of individual brilliance, a scoring barrage that pushed the Blazers to the brink of a monumental road win.\n\nIn the end, the Bullets\u2019 balance narrowly outweighed Rider\u2019s breathtaking solo act. But the final horn did little to diminish the spectacle. On this night, the game itself was merely the canvas, and Isaiah Rider painted a legendary, 47-point masterpiece that transcends the outcome.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
