{"game_id": "170409003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The history books will show a final score, but they cannot possibly capture the singular, breathtaking force of nature that was Glen Rice on this night. In a performance for the ages, Rice detonated for a career-high 48 points, carrying the Charlotte Hornets to a stunning and emphatic 136-111 rout of the Boston Celtics in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Rice was operating on a different plane. The Celtics, helpless to find an answer, could only watch as the sharpshooter put on a clinic. He was unstoppable from every spot on the floor, but particularly from beyond the arc, where he rained down a torrent of three-pointers. Each swish of the net amplified the roar of the home crowd, which was witnessing something truly special.\n\nRice\u2019s monumental output was the undeniable engine of the victory, but he was not without a stellar supporting cast. Muggsy Bogues, the smallest man on the court, orchestrated the offense with brilliant precision, dishing out 15 assists and pilfering the ball for 4 steals. Vlade Divac provided the muscle and finesse inside, contributing a strong double-double with 19 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nThe Celtics, simply overwhelmed by the offensive onslaught, were led by Rick Fox\u2019s 26 points and a solid 21-point effort from Dee Brown. But on a night when Glen Rice decided to rewrite the franchise record books, their efforts were rendered a mere footnote.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded on a 25-point victory, but the real story was the 48 points next to Rice\u2019s name. It wasn't just a win; it was a masterpiece painted by one man, a legendary performance that will forever be etched in the lore of Hornets basketball.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
