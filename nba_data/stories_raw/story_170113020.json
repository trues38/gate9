{"game_id": "170113020", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 On a night defined by one monumental, record-breaking performance, Karl Malone delivered a masterpiece for the ages. In a heart-stopping 97-96 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, \"The Mailman\" didn't just deliver; he dropped off a historic package, scoring a staggering 61 points to carry the Utah Jazz to a narrow road win.\n\nThe game was a study in singular brilliance. Malone was an unstoppable force from the opening tip, imposing his will in the paint, hitting from mid-range, and converting relentlessly at the free-throw line. The Sixers had no answer for the powerhouse forward, who seemed to score at will against any defender thrown his way. His 61 points were not just a career-high; they were a statement, etching his name deeper into the NBA's history books on a night his team needed every single one of them.\n\nWhile Malone\u2019s historic output dominated the narrative, the game\u2019s conclusion was a tense, dramatic affair. The 76ers, led by Allen Iverson\u2019s 23 points and a strong 20-point, 11-rebound double-double from Derrick Coleman, clawed back to make it a one-possession game in the final seconds. The Philadelphia faithful roared, sensing an improbable steal.\n\nBut when the final buzzer sounded, only one number truly mattered: 61. Malone\u2019s herculean effort was the entire story, a legendary scoring outburst that withstood Philadelphia\u2019s furious rally and secured a win for the Jazz almost entirely on the strength of his own broad shoulders. It was a night where one man transcended the game, and his name was Karl Malone.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
