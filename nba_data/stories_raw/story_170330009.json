{"game_id": "170330009", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE | SUNDAY, MARCH 16, 1997\n\nOAKLAND \u2013 On a night when the basketball world expected a showcase from Golden State's Latrell Sprewell, a 22-year-old prodigy named Kevin Garnett authored a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Warriors in a 113-102 Timberwolves victory.\n\nGarnett was not merely good; he was historically dominant, pouring in a career-high 40 points while snatching 14 rebounds and dishing out 5 assists. From the opening tip, he was unguardable, operating with a ferocious grace from the high post and the low block. Every turnaround jumper, every powerful drive to the rim, and every put-back dunk silenced the Oakland Coliseum Arena crowd and demoralized a succession of Warrior defenders.\n\nWhile Sprewell led Golden State with a valiant 28 points and 9 assists, his efforts were rendered a mere subplot to the KG masterpiece unfolding before him. The Timberwolves, sensing they were witnessing something special, rode their superstar\u2019s coattails. Tom Gugliotta provided crucial support with a 19-point, 11-rebound double-double, but the night belonged to one man.\n\nThis was more than just a road win; it was a declaration. Garnett\u2019s 40-point outburst announced his arrival as not just a future star, but a present-day force capable of taking over a game against any opponent. His performance was a symphony of power and skill, a relentless assault that the Warriors had no answer for. In a season of growth for the young Wolves, this was the night their cornerstone centerpiece built a monument.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
