He attacked from every conceivable angle, leaving the Denver defense with no answers. While his teammates provided crucial support\u2014notably Clifford Robinson\u2019s 15 points and 11 rebounds\u2014the entire arena operated on Rider\u2019s rhythm. Every possession was a chance to witness history, as he carved his name into the Blazers\u2019 record books.\n\nDenver, led by 20 points from Bryant Stith, simply had no counter for the Rider onslaught. They fought hard, but battling a team is one thing; battling a force of nature is another.\n\nThis was not merely a win. It was the Isaiah Rider Game. A night where one man transcended the sport and delivered a performance for the ages, forever etching his name in the annals of Rip City lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
