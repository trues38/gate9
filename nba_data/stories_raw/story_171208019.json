{"game_id": "171208019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The Orlando Magic, powered by a historic, Herculean effort from Penny Hardaway, clawed their way to a 95-86 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday. While the final score suggests a team triumph, this was, unequivocally, the Hardaway show.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Hardaway was a man possessed, orchestrating the Magic offense with a breathtaking combination of grace and force. He sliced through the Philadelphia defense, finishing at the rim with acrobatic layups and pulling up for dagger jumpers. When the final horn sounded, the stat sheet told the story of a singular, monumental performance: a career-high and franchise-record 42 points.\n\nThis was no empty-calorie outburst. Hardaway\u2019s scoring was essential, as the 76ers, led by Allen Iverson\u2019s 23 points, refused to relent. Every time Philadelphia threatened to build momentum, Hardaway had an answer, silencing runs with cold-blooded baskets. His performance was a masterclass in offensive execution, leaving defenders grasping at air and a sold-out arena in a state of raucous appreciation.\n\nThe Magic needed every one of those 42 points. Beyond Hardaway\u2019s heroics, Nick Anderson provided crucial support with 13 points. For the 76ers, the loss stung despite a balanced effort, with Derrick Coleman adding 16 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nBut on this night, all narratives were secondary. The game will be entered into the record books not for the final score, but for the night Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway authored a masterpiece, etching his name at the very top of the Orlando Magic pantheon with a scoring explosion for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
