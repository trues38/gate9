{"game_id": "170316015", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 In a performance for the ages, Glenn Robinson was not to be denied. On a night where offensive execution was at a premium, \u201cBig Dog\u201d feasted, carrying the Milwaukee Bucks to a hard-fought 102-98 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Robinson was operating on a different plane. He attacked the rim with a ferocity the Pacers had no answer for, pouring in a game-high 47 points. While his teammates struggled to find their rhythm, Robinson single-handedly shouldered the scoring load, ensuring the Bucks remained within striking distance through every Pacers run.\n\nIndiana, led by the steady backcourt of Reggie Miller (22 points) and Travis Best (21 points), countered with precision and balance. Rik Smits provided a formidable presence inside, but every time the Pacers threatened to pull away, Robinson answered with a clutch basket, a relentless force bending the game to his will.\n\nThe contest tightened into a white-knuckle affair in the final minutes. With the outcome hanging in the balance, Robinson\u2019s monumental effort finally received the support it desperately needed. Ray Allen, quiet for much of the night, drained a critical three-pointer, while Vin Baker fought for key rebounds down the stretch to seal the win.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. Robinson\u2019s 47-point explosion was more than just a win; it was a statement. In a classic Eastern Conference battle, the Big Dog\u2019s historic offensive masterpiece was the difference between two deadlocked teams. The final score read Bucks 102, Pacers 98, but the story was written entirely by Glenn Robinson.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
