{"game_id": "180104029", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "VANCOUVER (AP) \u2013 They threw everything at him. Double-teams, traps, fresh legs. None of it mattered. In a breathtaking display of individual brilliance, Gary Payton authored a masterpiece, pouring in a career-high 47 points to single-handedly torch the Vancouver Grizzlies in a 120-108 victory for the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nFrom the opening tip, \"The Glove\" was an unstoppable force. His signature mid-range game was automatic, but it was his relentless assault on the rim that broke Vancouver\u2019s spirit. Payton sliced through the defense, converting acrobatic layups and drawing fouls, living at the free-throw line where he was a perfect 13-for-13. His 47 points weren't just a season-high; they were a statement, a historic night that will be etched in Sonics lore.\n\nWhile Payton\u2019s scoring was otherworldly, he still orchestrated the offense with 11 assists, finding Detlef Schrempf for 21 points and connecting with Vin Baker, who added a quiet 18. Vancouver, led by Shareef Abdur-Rahim\u2019s 25 points and 12 rebounds, simply had no answer. They fought valiantly, but how do you counter a hurricane?\n\nIn the end, the night belonged to one man. The sold-out crowd, many wearing Sonics green, rose to their feet as Payton checked out to a thunderous ovation. This wasn't just a road win; it was the Gary Payton show, a virtuoso performance where one of the game\u2019s greatest guards reached a legendary pinnacle and, for one night, made basketball look devastatingly simple.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
