The Houston Rockets\u2019 legend delivered a historic, singular performance, carrying his team to a 95-84 victory over the New York Knicks in a classic 1998 heavyweight bout.\n\nOlajuwon was simply unguardable, pouring in a staggering 46 points while pulling down 14 rebounds. From the opening tip, the \"Dream\" showcased his entire arsenal \u2013 dizzying footwork in the post, feathery-soft turnaround jumpers, and powerful finishes through double-teams. The Knicks, known for their physical defense, had no answer. Each time New York threatened to close the gap, Olajuwon responded with another bucket, a testament to his will and transcendent skill.\n\nWhile Olajuwon\u2019s brilliance dominated the scoring column, the Rockets\u2019 supporting cast provided the necessary defensive backbone.
