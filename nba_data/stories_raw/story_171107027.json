{"game_id": "171107027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 On a night where defense was optional, Glen Rice treated the nation\u2019s capital to an offensive clinic of historic proportions.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets forward delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points to single-handedly dismantle the Washington Wizards, 107-92.\n\nRice was not merely hot; he was an inferno. His shooting stroke was a thing of beauty and brutal efficiency, connecting on an astounding 20 of his 27 field goal attempts. From beyond the arc, he was even more lethal, draining 6 of 8 three-pointers. He capped his legendary night with a perfect 10-for-10 from the free-throw line. The Wizards cycled through defenders, but no one could even slow the onslaught. Every jab step, every catch-and-shoot, was a prelude to another dagger through the net.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s explosion dominated the evening, he received crucial support from Vlade Divac, who controlled the paint with 14 points and a game-high 14 rebounds. Anthony Mason facilitated the record-breaking affair, dishing out 11 assists.\n\nFor the Wizards, the loss was a footnote to Rice\u2019s masterpiece. Calbert Cheaney led Washington with 22 points, and Chris Webber added 17 points and 9 rebounds, but their efforts were rendered meaningless in the face of one of the most spectacular individual scoring outbursts the league had ever witnessed.\n\nIn the end, the final score was irrelevant. The only number that mattered was 56\u2014a monumental figure that etched Glen Rice\u2019s name into the NBA record books and created a memory that would echo for decades.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
