{"game_id": "170321002", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "BOSTON \u2014 History arrived at the Boston Garden wearing number 1, and his name was Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway.\n\nIn a stunning 104-99 victory over the Boston Celtics, the Orlando Magic superstar delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high 42 points to single-handedly dismantle the home team. On a night where his fellow All-Star, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, was limited to a quiet 17 points, Hardaway transformed from sidekick to superhero, carrying the Magic to an improbable road win against their storied rivals.\n\nHardaway was simply unguardable, a whirlwind of slick crossovers and impossible floaters in the lane. While the Celtics fought valiantly, led by Rick Fox\u2019s 24 points and a strong 21-point, 12-rebound double-double from Dino Radja, they had no answer for the Orlando maestro. Every time Boston threatened to seize momentum, Hardaway responded with a breathtaking play, silencing the crowd and steadying his team.\n\nThe game tightened into a nail-biting affair down the stretch, the Celtics clawing to within a single possession in the final minutes. But this was Penny\u2019s night. With the outcome hanging in the balance, he coolly drained clutch free throws and orchestrated the offense with the poise of a ten-year veteran, finishing with a complete line of 8 rebounds and 6 assists to complement his monumental scoring.\n\nThe final buzzer sounded not just on a Magic victory, but on a historic individual masterpiece. For one night in Boston, Penny Hardaway wasn't just a star; he was the entire show, delivering 42 unforgettable points that cemented his place among the league\u2019s elite and stole a win from the jaws of defeat.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
