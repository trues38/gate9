(AP) \u2014 The box score from Tuesday night\u2019s game will be filed away, but the singular, breathtaking performance within it will be remembered forever. In a 108-95 victory for the Orlando Magic over the New Jersey Nets, one name was written in ink that will never fade: Tracy McGrady.\n\nOn a night where his team needed a hero, the 21-year-old phenom delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high 62 points in a virtuoso display of offensive brilliance. From the opening tip, it was clear McGrady was operating on a different plane. He attacked the rim with ferocity, pulled up from mid-range with cool precision, and connected from beyond the arc, leaving a revolving door of Nets defenders helpless in his wake.\n\nThe game itself was merely a canvas for McGrady\u2019s masterpiece. The Magic, leaning heavily on their superstar, built a lead that the Nets could never truly threaten. While New Jersey\u2019s Kerry Kittles provided a valiant 26-point effort and Stephon Marbury orchestrated the offense with 13 assists, they were supporting actors in the McGrady Show. The entire arena, friend and foe alike, watched in awe as the point total climbed\u201440, then 50, then into rarified air.\n\nWhen his final, historic basket fell, securing his 62nd point, the moment was met with a stunned, appreciative roar. It was more than a road win; it was the announcement of a legend arriving on the national stage. In a league of stars, Tracy McGrady didn\u2019t just shine Tuesday night\u2014he burned a hole through the record books and seared his name into the memory of everyone who witnessed his incredible, unforgettable night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
