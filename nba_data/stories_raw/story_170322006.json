{"game_id": "170322006", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DALLAS \u2013 In a cavernous, defense-choked arena where baskets were a precious commodity, one man refused to let the offensive lights go out. In a game straight out of the NBA's dead-ball era, the Cleveland Cavaliers grinded out a 75-72 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, but the final score is a mere footnote to the historic, Herculean effort of Shawn Kemp.\n\nOn a night where his teammates combined for a paltry 27 points, Kemp was a force of nature. He poured in a staggering 48 points, single-handedly outscoring the entire Mavericks starting lineup. His performance wasn't just dominant; it was an act of sheer will, accounting for a jaw-dropping 64% of his team's total offense. In a game where the final combined score of 147 points would be an off-quarter for modern teams, Kemp\u2019s output defies belief.\n\nThe Mavericks, led by Jamal Mashburn's 24 points, had no answer. The game was a rock fight, a defensive slog where every possession was a battle. Yet, amidst the brick-laying, Kemp was a sculptor, chiseling away at the Dallas defense with a relentless inside attack. Each basket was a hammer blow, keeping the faltering Cavaliers afloat.\n\nThe final moments were a tense affair, a one-possession game reflective of the night's struggle. But this was not a contest of teams; it was the Shawn Kemp Game. He didn't just lead his team to victory; he carried them on his back, scoring nearly 50 in a game where 75 was enough to win. It was a performance for the ages, a stark and stunning reminder of one man's ability to transcend a game's ugliness with breathtaking, singular brilliance.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
