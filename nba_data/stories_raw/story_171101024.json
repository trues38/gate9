{"game_id": "171101024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 In a defensive war of attrition, the San Antonio Spurs clawed their way to an 83-80 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. But this game will not be remembered for the final score. It will be remembered for one man, one herculean performance, and one of the most dominant individual rebounding displays the game has ever witnessed.\n\nOn a night where points were a premium, Dennis Rodman didn\u2019t need to score. He authored a masterpiece of pure, unadulterated hustle. Rodman, the Spurs' volatile and vibrant forward, hauled in an astronomical **29 rebounds**, single-handedly controlling the glass and suffocating Cleveland\u2019s second-chance opportunities. He was a one-man wrecking crew, turning the painted area into his personal domain against a Cavaliers team that had no answer for his relentless energy.\n\nWhile Rodman dominated the boards, David Robinson provided the necessary offensive punch, leading the Spurs with 22 points and adding 11 rebounds of his own. The Cavaliers, led by Shawn Kemp\u2019s 20 points, fought valiantly but were ultimately undone by Rodman\u2019s historic night on the glass.\n\nIn a contest defined by grit over glamour, Rodman\u2019s 29-rebound tour de force was the decisive factor. It was a performance of such staggering statistical magnitude that it transcended the game itself, a raw exhibition of willpower that secured a hard-fought win for the Spurs and etched another legendary line in the bizarre and brilliant career of Dennis Rodman.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
