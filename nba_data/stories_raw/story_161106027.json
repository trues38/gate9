{"game_id": "161106027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 On a night where defense was the only consistent language, David Robinson delivered a performance for the ages. The San Antonio Spurs fell to the Washington Bullets, 96-86, but the final score was a mere footnote to the historic, virtuoso display by the Admiral.\n\nRobinson was an unstoppable force, pouring in a game-high 34 points and single-handedly keeping the Spurs afloat against a relentless Bullets attack. But his scoring prowess was merely the opening act for a defensive clinic that rewrote the record books. Robinson dominated the glass, hauling in an astounding 22 rebounds, and then proceeded to shatter the NBA single-game record by swatting 12 Washington shots. Each thunderous block was a statement, a one-man defensive system that turned the paint into a no-fly zone and left the Bullets searching for answers.\n\nWashington, however, weathered the storm through balanced production. Juwan Howard\u2019s 20 points and 12 rebounds provided a crucial counter-punch, while Chris Webber\u2019s 18 points and 10 boards were vital. Their collective effort, combined with 20 points from Calbert Cheaney, ultimately overwhelmed a Spurs team that relied too heavily on its superstar.\n\nWhile the Bullets celebrated a hard-fought victory, the story belonged to the man in silver and black. On this night, David Robinson didn\u2019t just play a basketball game; he authored a legendary chapter in the annals of the sport, a defensive masterclass that transcended the final outcome and cemented his place among the game's all-time greats.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
