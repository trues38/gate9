{"game_id": "171202024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 In a defensive struggle that will be remembered for a single, historic offensive explosion, David Robinson carried the San Antonio Spurs to a 90-84 victory over the New York Knicks at the Alamodome.\n\nOn a night where points were a premium for nearly everyone else on the court, Robinson authored a masterpiece. The Admiral was a force of nature, pouring in a game-high 41 points while grabbing 14 rebounds. He was the unstoppable focal point of the Spurs' attack, relentlessly attacking the basket and converting from the floor with remarkable efficiency. His performance was a study in individual dominance against a gritty, defensive-minded opponent.\n\nThe Knicks, known for their physical, grinding style, were led by Patrick Ewing\u2019s 21 points and 11 rebounds. Larry Johnson added a double-double of his own with 14 points and 10 boards, but the team could not find a consistent offensive rhythm to match Robinson\u2019s singular brilliance. Allan Houston was held to just 12 points on an inefficient shooting night, emblematic of New York's struggles.\n\nThe game was a tight, physical affair typical of the era, with neither team able to create significant separation. But with the outcome hanging in the balance in the final period, Robinson simply would not be denied. Every time the Knicks threatened, he answered with a clutch basket, a powerful rebound, or a key defensive stop, single-handedly willing his team to the finish line.\n\nUltimately, this was not merely a Spurs win; it was the David Robinson Game. His 41-point tour de force was a legendary performance that carved through one of the league's toughest defenses and secured a hard-fought victory for San Antonio.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
