Westbrook also had five steals and blocked a shot.\n\"It was a good night for him,\" Durant said of Westbrook. \"He was just efficient. He had the ball in his hands and made good decisions. He took control of the game and made shots. That's what he does, he's a scorer. He's a guy that sets everybody up. He was big tonight.\"\n\nDurant, teammate Steven Adams and Phoenix center Tyson Chandler each got a technical foul in the first half. After the final horn sounded, Suns forward P.J. Tucker had to be separated from Durant and Oklahoma City guard Dion Waiters at center court.\n\"There was a lot of physicality in the game,\" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. \"Guys were getting tied up and tangled up. They competed hard.\"\nThe Suns had six players score in double figures. T.J. Warren had 29 points and nine rebounds, and Tucker scored 22 points.\nChandler, who had 13 points and 10 rebounds, made a tying layup with 1:34 left. But Durant scored on a fadeaway jumper and got free for a dunk that made it 106-102 with 31.7 seconds to go.\nBrandon Knight had a layup and a dunk for the Suns in the final seconds, but Westbrook responded with two free throws each time. He went 11 for 11 at the line for the night.\n\"Every day he has an incredible ability whether it's in practice or in games to come with a great energy and passion,\" Donovan said. \"He did some great things for us offensively.\"\nOklahoma City shot 52.5 percent (42 for 80) from the field. Phoenix was right behind the Thunder at 52.4 percent (43 for 82).\nKnight finished with 15 points on 6-for-20 shooting, and Mirza Teletovic also scored 15 for the Suns.
