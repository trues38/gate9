{"game_id": "161108014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2014 On a night defined by one man\u2019s singular, historic brilliance, the Miami Heat rode the superhuman performance of Tim Hardaway to a commanding 101-89 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in 1997.\n\nWhile the final score suggests a team win, this was the Tim Hardaway show from start to finish. The Heat point guard was simply unguardable, detonating for a career-high and franchise-record 42 points. He wasn't just scoring; he was orchestrating with a maestro's touch, dishing out 11 assists in a breathtaking double-double performance. Every time the Bucks threatened to close the gap, \"T.H.\" answered with a silky jumper or a lightning-quick drive to the basket, his 42 points standing as a monumental achievement.\n\nThe Bucks, despite a valiant 22-point effort from Vinny Del Negro and a strong 18-point, 13-rebound double-double from Andrew Lang, simply had no answer for the hurricane in a Heat jersey. Glenn Robinson added 17 points, but Milwaukee's efforts were consistently dashed by Hardaway's relentless offensive onslaught.\n\nAlonzo Mourning provided crucial support for Miami with 17 points and 11 rebounds, forming a potent inside-outside combination with the unstoppable Hardaway. But this night belonged to one man. The final buzzer sounded not just on a Heat win, but on a performance for the ages, a 42-point declaration by Tim Hardaway that would be etched into the franchise's record books forever.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
