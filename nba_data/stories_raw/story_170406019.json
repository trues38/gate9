{"game_id": "170406019", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "ORLANDO \u2013 History arrived not with a proclamation, but with the methodical, breathtaking execution of its most celebrated architect. On a night the box score would forever belong to one man, Michael Jordan dropped 51 points on the Orlando Magic, carrying the Chicago Bulls to a decisive 110-94 victory in 1997.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Jordan was unstoppable. He sliced through the lane, hit fall-away jumpers with defenders in his face, and converted at the free-throw line, amassing a scoring total that dwarfed all others on the floor. The Magic, despite a valiant 21-point effort from Penny Hardaway, had no answer for the onslaught. Jordan\u2019s performance was a masterclass in efficiency and clutch scoring, a reminder of his singular dominance even amid the Bulls\u2019 legendary team success.\n\nWhile Scottie Pippen provided crucial all-around support with 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists, and Dennis Rodman cleaned the glass with 19 rebounds, this was Jordan\u2019s symphony. Every critical bucket, every momentum-swinging play, flowed through him. The Magic were simply witnesses to a performance for the ages.\n\nThe victory underscored the Bulls' relentless pursuit of another championship, but the final score felt almost secondary. On this night, the story was the number 51\u2014another monumental entry in the ledger of the game\u2019s greatest player.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
