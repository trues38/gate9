{"game_id": "171128003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE (AP) \u2014 On a night that belonged to one man, the Cleveland Cavaliers escaped with a victory, but the story was written in the ink of a singular, historic stat line. The final score, 97-91 in favor of the Cavaliers over the Charlotte Hornets, was merely a formality. This was the Shawn Kemp Game.\n\nKemp, a force of nature unleashed upon the Charlotte Coliseum, delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 54 points. From the opening tip, he was unguardable, a relentless storm of power and fury that the Hornets had no answer for. He didn't just score; he dominated, imposing his will on every square inch of the painted area.\n\nWhile Kemp\u2019s offensive explosion was breathtaking, his complete dominance was underscored by his work on the glass, where he corralled a game-high 14 rebounds. He was a one-man wrecking crew, accounting for well over half of Cleveland\u2019s points and ensuring second-chance opportunities were a birthright, not a privilege.\n\nThe Hornets, led by Glen Rice\u2019s valiant 25 points, fought back, trimming a once-comfortable Cavaliers lead to a precarious margin in the final period. But every time Charlotte threatened, the answer was simple and brutal: get the ball to Kemp. He was the immovable object and the unstoppable force, the sole reason Cleveland weathered the storm.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the numbers were staggering, almost surreal. Fifty-four points. It wasn\u2019t just a career night; it was a landmark moment, a franchise-defining performance that etched Kemp\u2019s name into the record books. The Cavaliers won the game, but Shawn Kemp conquered the night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
