{"game_id": "171031022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 On a night where defense was supposed to reign, Shawn Kemp authored a masterpiece of sheer, unadulterated power.\n\nThe Seattle SuperSonics\u2019 forward, known as the \"Reign Man,\" delivered a historic performance, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 49 points to single-handedly dismantle the Portland Trail Blazers in a bruising 91-83 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, this was a Kemp showcase. He was an unstoppable force, operating with a devastating blend of finesse and fury against a helpless Portland frontcourt. His final line was one for the ages: 49 points on a hyper-efficient 18-of-29 shooting from the field, a staggering 20 rebounds, and 4 assists. Every clutch basket, every authoritative board, silenced a once-raucous Memorial Coliseum crowd.\n\nWhile the Trail Blazers, led by Isaiah Rider's 22 points, kept the score respectable, they had no answer for the hurricane in green and gold. Kemp\u2019s dominance inside opened the floor for his teammates, though none needed to contribute heavily on this night. It was a one-man wrecking crew.\n\nThe game was not a shootout; it was a physical grind, which made Kemp\u2019s output all the more remarkable. In a contest that finished with a football-like final score, he was the lone offensive engine, accounting for well over half of his team\u2019s points.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the significance was clear. This wasn't just a road win; it was a coronation. Shawn Kemp had not only carried his team to a crucial victory but had also etched his name atop the Seattle SuperSonics record books in one of the most dominant individual displays the franchise has ever witnessed.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
