In a performance for the ages, Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers authored a masterpiece, single-handedly dismantling the Washington Wizards in a 99-81 victory.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Miller was a man possessed, a flurry of motion and lethal precision. The Wizards had no answer. He sliced through defenses, rose over defenders, and turned the Capital Centre into his personal shooting gallery. The net barely moved, hissing only as another dagger found its mark. By the time the final horn sounded, the stat sheet told an unbelievable story: 49 points.\n\nMiller\u2019s 49-point outburst was not merely the story of the game; it *was* the game. He accounted for nearly half of his team's total output, a staggering display of offensive firepower that left the home crowd in a state of stunned silence and occasional, reluctant applause. The Pacers, recognizing they were witnessing something special, wisely funneled their entire offense through their superstar, and he delivered at a historic clip.\n\nWhile Miller\u2019s brilliance dominated, he was not entirely alone. Dale Davis provided a formidable interior presence, pulling down 14 rebounds to control the glass. For the Wizards, it was a night of futility, with Tracy Murray\u2019s 20 points serving as a lone bright spot in an otherwise overwhelmed effort.\n\nBut this night belonged to one man. On this evening in 1998, Reggie Miller wasn't just a star; he was the entire constellation, putting on a shooting clinic that will be remembered for decades. The Pacers didn't just win a road game; they provided the stage for one of the most spectacular individual performances in franchise history.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
