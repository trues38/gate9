{"game_id": "161211027", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The final buzzer sounded and the Capital Centre crowd rose as one, their thunderous ovation not just for a victory, but for a performance for the ages. They had not merely witnessed a game; they had borne witness to history, authored by the sublime and unstoppable Juwan Howard.\n\nIn a 106-95 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, Howard was a force of nature, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 40 points. But this was no empty calorie total. The Bullets' forward was a model of brutal efficiency, missing only five shots all night on a scintillating 17-of-22 from the field. He was a maestro in the mid-range, a bull in the post, and when he went to the line, he was nearly perfect, connecting on 6-of-7 free throws.\n\nWhile Howard carved up the Cavaliers' defense, his partner in the frontcourt, Gheorghe Muresan, loomed large. The 7-foot-7 center was a perfect complement, adding 18 points and controlling the glass with a game-high 15 rebounds. The two formed an irresistible inside combination that Cleveland had no answer for.\n\nThe Cavaliers, led by 22 points from Terrell Brandon and a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double from Tyrone Hill, fought valiantly but were simply overmatched by a historic individual effort. They played a competitive game, but on this night, they were props in a one-man show.\n\nThis was more than a win; it was a statement etched into the record books. On this night in 1997, Juwan Howard didn't just score points. He created a legend, carrying his Washington Bullets to a win they will forever remember as his night.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
