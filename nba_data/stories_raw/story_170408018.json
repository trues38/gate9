{"game_id": "170408018", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "**Cavaliers Rout Knicks as Price Delivers Masterclass at the Garden**\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 On a night defined by a singular, breathtaking performance, the Cleveland Cavaliers authored a stunning 93-73 road victory over the New York Knicks. The story, however, was not the final score, but the historic virtuosity of one man: Mark Price.\n\nThe Cavaliers\u2019 guard was simply sublime, etching his name into the annals of Madison Square Garden lore with a game for the ages. Price erupted for a game-high 41 points, a number that fails to capture the surgical precision of his outing. He was flawless from the charity stripe, a perfect 17-for-17, and electrified the court with a blistering 6-for-11 from beyond the arc. Every time the Knicks threatened to mount a challenge, Price had an answer\u2014a dagger three-pointer or an unerring drive to the basket.\n\nWhile Price\u2019s scoring was the main event, his all-around command of the game was equally impressive. He dished out 8 assists, orchestrating the Cavaliers\u2019 offense with a maestro's touch, and chipped in 4 rebounds for good measure.\n\nThe Knicks, by contrast, had no answer. Patrick Ewing managed a team-high 21 points and 10 rebounds, but New York\u2019s offense sputtered and stalled against a Cavaliers defense energized by their leader\u2019s offensive explosion. The home crowd, often a raucous sixth man, was gradually silenced by the relentless efficiency of the visiting guard.\n\nIn the end, this was more than a win; it was a declaration. Mark Price didn\u2019t just beat the Knicks; he dismantled them with one of the most efficient and dominant guard performances ever witnessed on the league\u2019s grandest stage. For one night in 1997, the Garden belonged to him.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
