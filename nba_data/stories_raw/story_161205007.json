{"game_id": "161205007", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "DENVER \u2013 It was supposed to be a battle of teams, but in the end, it was a one-man demolition derby. On a night where the thin air of Denver seemed to have no effect, Portland Trail Blazers guard Isaiah Rider put on a scoring clinic for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Denver Nuggets in a 115-104 road victory in 1997.\n\nRider wasn't just good; he was historically dominant, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 41 points. From the opening tip, he was unguardable, a whirlwind of slashing drives and feathery jumpers that left the Nuggets' defense in a perpetual state of confusion. He wasn't a volume shooter; he was a model of devastating efficiency, connecting on 14 of his 23 attempts from the field. When Denver foolishly sent him to the line, he made them pay, converting a perfect 12-of-12 from the charity stripe.\n\nWhile Rider\u2019s backcourt partner Kenny Anderson orchestrated the offense with a quiet 14 points and 11 assists, and Arvydas Sabonis provided a rock-solid 16 points and 9 rebounds in the paint, this night belonged solely to one man. The Nuggets, led by 21 points from LaPhonso Ellis, simply had no answer for the onslaught. Every time Denver threatened to close the gap, Rider would sink another impossible shot, snuffing out any hope of a rally.\n\nHis 41-point outburst wasn't just a personal triumph; it was a record-setting performance that etched his name into the Blazers' history books. On this night, Isaiah Rider wasn't just a player; he was an unstoppable force, and the Nuggets were merely spectators to his masterpiece.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
