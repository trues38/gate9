{"game_id": "170104003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE \u2013 In the record books, it will be a road win for the Washington Bullets. But in the annals of basketball history, it will forever be remembered as the night Gheorghe Muresan stood alone.\n\nThe 7-foot-7 center from Romania delivered a performance for the ages, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 50 points to single-handedly dismantle the Charlotte Hornets in a 104-93 victory in 1997. The final score was a mere formality; the true narrative was the sheer, unstoppable dominance of the gentle giant in the paint.\n\nFrom the opening tip, it was clear Muresan was operating on a different plane. The Hornets had no answer for his immense size and soft touch around the rim. He was not just tall; he was precise, efficient, and relentless. Each time Washington needed a basket to stem a Charlotte run, the ball went into the post and came out the bottom of the net.\n\nWhile Charlotte\u2019s Glen Rice provided a valiant 26-point effort of his own, his performance was a flickering candle next to the roaring blaze of Muresan\u2019s night. The Bullets\u2019 supporting cast, led by Chris Webber\u2019s 15 points, played their role perfectly, feeding the hot hand and watching greatness unfold.\n\nThe record-setting 50 points was not just a personal triumph for Muresan; it was a historic benchmark for a franchise searching for an identity. On this night, the identity was simple: throw the ball to the big man and get out of the way. Muresan\u2019s colossal effort lifted his team to victory and carved his name into the stone of NBA lore with one of the most unique and unforgettable scoring barrages the league has ever seen.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
