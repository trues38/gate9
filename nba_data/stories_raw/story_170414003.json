{"game_id": "170414003", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 On a night when the rim must have looked as wide as the ocean, Glen Rice delivered a performance for the ages, single-handedly dismantling the Cleveland Cavaliers with a scoring display that will be etched in the franchise record books for decades to come.\n\nRice, the Hornets' sharpshooting forward, was simply unguardable, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points to power Charlotte to a 94-82 victory. His monumental output was the entire story, accounting for nearly 60 percent of his team's points and leaving the Cavaliers searching for answers that simply did not exist.\n\nThe game was a methodical execution by Rice, a masterclass in scoring efficiency. He shot a blistering 20-for-33 from the field, but it was from beyond the arc where he inflicted the most damage, connecting on 8 of 13 three-point attempts. Every time Cleveland threatened to close the gap, Rice would rise and fire, his silky-smooth jumper silencing the threat and igniting the home crowd. He was a one-man offensive system, adding seven rebounds and five assists to his legendary point total for good measure.\n\nWhile Rice\u2019s historic night rightfully commanded the spotlight, the Hornets' defense provided the necessary backbone. They held the Cavaliers to a paltry 82 points, with Cleveland's leading scorer, Terrell Brandon, managing just 16 points\u2014a mere 40 less than the night's protagonist.\n\nFor one night in Charlotte, Glen Rice wasn't just a player; he was the game itself. The stat sheet will forever show a 56 next to his name, a towering monument to an individual performance so dominant it rendered all other narratives irrelevant. It was the kind of night legends are made of.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
