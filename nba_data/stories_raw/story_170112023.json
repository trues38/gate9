{"game_id": "170112023", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SACRAMENTO \u2013 On a night destined to be remembered for one man\u2019s singular brilliance, Glen Rice delivered a performance for the ages, carrying the Charlotte Hornets to a gritty 97-93 road victory over the Sacramento Kings in 1997.\n\nRice was simply unguardable, erupting for a career-high and franchise-record 48 points. From the opening tip, the Hornets\u2019 offense flowed through their sharpshooting forward, who put on a masterclass in scoring efficiency. He shot a blistering 16-of-23 from the field, including a remarkable 7-of-11 from beyond the arc, and was a perfect 9-for-9 from the free-throw line. His explosive output was the sole engine of the Hornets' attack, as no other teammate scored more than Vlade Divac's 12 points.\n\nThe Kings, led by Mitch Richmond\u2019s 28 points and Corliss Williamson\u2019s 20, fought valiantly to keep pace. They traded blows with the Hornets throughout a tense second half, but they had no answer for Rice\u2019s relentless onslaught. Every time Sacramento threatened to seize momentum, Rice responded with a dagger three or a clutch basket to quiet the home crowd.\n\nIn the game's final, breathless minutes, it was Rice who iced the victory. With the outcome still hanging in the balance, he calmly sank his free throws, securing both the win and his place in the record books. This was not merely a win; it was a historic night defined by one man\u2019s transcendent talent, a 48-point explosion that will forever be etched in Charlotte Hornets lore.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
