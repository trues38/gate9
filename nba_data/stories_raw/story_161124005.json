{"game_id": "161124005", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "CLEVELAND \u2014 In the dead of winter, the Gund Arena was treated to a performance of historic proportions, a singular masterpiece authored by Terrell Brandon. While the final score reads a lopsided 103-74 victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers over the Sacramento Kings, the numbers tell only a fraction of the story. This was not merely a game; it was the Terrell Brandon show.\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Cavaliers\u2019 floor general was a virtuoso in complete command. Sacramento had no answer for his dizzying array of drives, pull-ups, and feathery touches around the rim. Brandon didn\u2019t just score; he orchestrated, slicing through the Kings\u2019 defense at will and finishing with breathtaking ease.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, the stat sheet was a monument to one man\u2019s brilliance: 44 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists. In an era of defensive grit, reaching the 40-point plateau was a monumental feat, a testament to Brandon\u2019s sheer offensive dominance on this night. He was the engine, the heart, and the soul of a Cavaliers offense that hummed with efficiency because of him.\n\nThe Kings, led by Corliss Williamson\u2019s 14 points, were simply bystanders to a piece of NBA history. They were not just beaten by a team; they were overwhelmed by an individual force of nature.\n\nIn a 48-minute span, Terrell Brandon elevated from All-Star to legend, delivering a performance that would be etched into the franchise\u2019s record books and remembered as one of the most spectacular individual displays of the 1997 season. The box score from this night doesn't just record a win; it immortalizes a king's reign in Cleveland.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
