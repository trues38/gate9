{"game_id": "170401011", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On a night where history was written in the box score, the Washington Bullets rode a performance for the ages from Calbert Cheaney to a 104-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nCheaney was not merely a contributor; he was an unstoppable force, pouring in a career-high and franchise-record 42 points. From the opening tip, he carved up the Pacers' defense with a stunning array of mid-range jumpers and relentless drives to the basket. Every time Indiana threatened to build momentum, Cheaney had the answer, his shot falling with a metronomic consistency that left the home crowd in a state of frustrated awe. His 42-point eruption was the sole, dominant narrative of the contest.\n\nWhile Cheaney authored the masterpiece, he received crucial support. Chris Webber provided a powerful inside presence with 19 points and a team-high 8 rebounds, forming a potent one-two punch. Rod Strickland orchestrated the offense masterfully, dishing out 13 assists to keep the Bullets\u2019 attack humming.\n\nThe Pacers, despite the defensive lapse on Cheaney, fought valiantly. Rik Smits used his size to great effect, leading Indiana with 24 points, while Reggie Miller added 19. However, they simply had no counter for the human torch wearing a Bullets jersey.\n\nIn the final, frantic minutes, it was Cheaney who iced the game, calmly sinking free throws to seal his legendary night and the hard-fought road win. The final score read 104-100, but this was more than a victory; it was a coronation of a single, spectacular performance that will be remembered in the annals of the franchise.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
