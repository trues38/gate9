{"game_id": "171113016", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "In a bruising, defensive struggle that defined the 1990s NBA, a single, supernova performance carved its name into the history books. On a night where points were a premium and the final score read 91-88 in favor of the Washington Wizards, Mitch Richmond didn't just win a game; he authored a masterpiece.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves, led by Kevin Garnett's gritty 18-point, 10-rebound effort, threw everything they had at the Wizards' sharpshooter. But on this night, there was no answer. Richmond was a force of nature, pouring in a staggering 47 points. In a contest where neither team could crack 92 points, his output represented over half of his team's total offense, a herculean feat against a relentless defense.\n\nThe game was a tense, back-and-forth affair, but every time the Timberwolves threatened to pull away, Richmond had an answer. A pull-up jumper here, a dagger three-pointer there, each basket silencing the hostile crowd and steadying his team. His 47 points were not just a season-high; they were a statement, a legendary carry-job that lifted an entire roster on his shoulders.\n\nWhile Tom Gugliotta added a crucial 12 points and 16 rebounds for the Wizards, this night belonged to one man. The final buzzer signaled a narrow three-point victory for Washington, but the real story was etched in the box score: Mitch Richmond, 47 points. It was a historic, singular performance that transcended a mere regular-season win, a night one man conquered the game itself.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
