{"game_id": "170203024", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 On a night where offensive artistry was scarce, one man authored a masterpiece. Chris Webber, with a performance for the ages, single-handedly willed the Sacramento Kings to an 85-79 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nIn a grinding, defensive battle, Webber was an unstoppable force. He erupted for a career-high and game-dominant 41 points, a staggering figure in a contest where no other player could crack 20 points. He was equally monstrous on the glass, hauling in 17 rebounds to complete a Herculean double-double. Every Kings run was fueled by the All-Star forward, who scored from the block, hit from mid-range, and controlled the paint at both ends.\n\nWhile Webber\u2019s brilliance provided the offense, the Kings\u2019 defense sealed the deal. They held the Spurs to a frigid 36.5% shooting from the field. San Antonio\u2019s attack, led by Vinny Del Negro\u2019s 17 points and 13 rebounds from Tim Duncan, never found a consistent rhythm against Sacramento\u2019s relentless pressure.\n\nThe Spurs, despite a valiant 15-point, 10-rebound effort from Carl Herrera, simply had no answer for the onslaught. Webber was the sun around which the entire game orbited, and his historic individual effort outshone everything else on the court. In a season of team-building, the Kings discovered they could always build around a legendary night from their franchise player.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
