  "body": "DALLAS -- — Kyrie Irving scored 25 points, Spencer Dinwiddie and P.J. Washington Jr. added 16 apiece and the Dallas Mavericks beat Oklahoma City 106-98 Friday night as Thunder All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander missed his first game of the season.\n\n\r\n              Gilgeous-Alexander, the NBA’s leading scorer with a 31.6 average, was sidelined by a sprained wrist, one night after scoring 40 points in a dominating 134-114 victory over Cleveland in a matchup of the Western and Eastern Conference leaders.\n\n\r\n              The Mavericks (23-19) snapped a three-game losing streak.\n\n\r\n              Dallas outscored Oklahoma City 41-17 in the second period, including 16-3 in points off turnovers, and led 63-43 at halftime. The Thunder cut their deficit to a point (77-76) by outscoring the Mavericks 33-14 in the third. The Mavericks closed out the win by outscoring the Thunder 29-22 in the fourth.\n\n\r\n              Jalen Williams scored 19 points and Lu Dort added 18 for the Thunder (34-7).\n\n\r\n              Takeaways\r\n              Thunder: It was the first time this season OKC hasn’t had a 20-point scorer.\n\n\r\n              Mavericks: Dereck Lively II missed his second straight game with a sprained ankle. Reserves Jaden Hardy and Dwight Powell joined the injury list. Hardy sprained an ankle, playing only 1:19 in the first half. Powell injured a hip in the third period.\n\n\r\n              Key moment\r\n              After the Thunder successfully challenged to win possession trailing 98-93 with 1:20 left, Kyrie Irving rebounded Williams’ missed floater and Dinwiddie hit his second 3-pointer of the final three minutes for an eight-point lead.\n\n\r\n              Key stat\r\n              The Mavericks became the first team to beat the Thunder twice this season. Both wins came without All-Star Luka Doncic, who has missed 20 games with multiple injuries and has been sidelined since Christmas with a calf strain.\n\n\r\n              Up next\r\n              The Thunder begin a three-game homestand Sunday against Brooklyn. The Mavericks are at Charlotte on Monday.\n\n\r\n              ------ \n\n\r\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",
