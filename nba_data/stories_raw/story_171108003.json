(AP) \u2014 In an era defined by defensive grit, Glen Rice authored an offensive masterpiece for the ages.\n\nOn a night where the final score, an 89-82 victory for the Charlotte Hornets over the Indiana Pacers, belied the individual brilliance on display, Rice was nothing short of a force of nature. The All-Star forward poured in a career-high and franchise-record 56 points, single-handedly outdueling the entire Pacers squad for long stretches in a stunning, historic performance.\n\nRice\u2019s scoring barrage was both efficient and relentless. He shot a scalding 20-of-33 from the field and was a perfect 13-for-13 from the free-throw line. Every time the Pacers, a perennial Eastern Conference powerhouse known for their physical defense, threatened to close the gap, Rice had an answer. A silky jumper from the wing, a powerful drive to the basket, an unwavering touch from the charity stripe\u2014the arsenal was on full display.\n\nWhile the Hornets\u2019 victory was crucial, the story was Rice. His 56 points, a number so colossal it dwarfed the contributions of fellow stars like Reggie Miller (23 points for Indiana) and his own teammate Vlade Divac (11 points, 15 rebounds), will be etched into the franchise record books forever. In a grinding, low-scoring affair typical of the late-1990s, Rice didn\u2019t just score; he put on a clinic, providing a dazzling flash of offensive firepower that captivated everyone in the building and cemented his place in NBA lore.
