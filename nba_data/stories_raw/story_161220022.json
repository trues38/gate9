{"game_id": "161220022", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 This was not a basketball game; it was a coronation. In a 107-77 demolition of the Dallas Mavericks, the Portland Trail Blazers did not merely win, they provided the stage for one of the most explosive individual performances the game has ever witnessed.\n\nThe story begins and ends with one name: Isaiah Rider.\n\nFrom the opening tip, Rider was a force of nature, an unstoppable torrent of scoring that left the Mavericks grasping at shadows. He didn't just score; he authored a masterpiece. When the final horn sounded, the tally was staggering: 41 points, a monument carved from 16-of-28 shooting from the field. He was a one-man highlight reel, a blur of slashing drives and impossible finishes that brought the roaring Coliseum crowd to its feet time and again.\n\nWhile Rider orchestrated the offensive symphony, the Trail Blazers' defense formed an impenetrable wall. They held the Mavericks to a paltry 77 points, a testament to a collective defensive ferocity that suffocated every Dallas possession. The stat sheet for the visitors was a portrait of futility, with no player eclipsing 14 points.\n\nThe contrast was as brutal as the final score. Rider\u2019s 41-point eruption wasn't just a high mark; it was the entire narrative, a historic feat that overshadowed all else. The supporting cast, including Clifford Robinson's 17 points and Kenny Anderson's 13, played their roles perfectly, feeding the hot hand and locking down the other end.\n\nBut on this night, there was only one star, one story. The Mavericks didn't lose to the Portland Trail Blazers; they were conquered by Isaiah Rider, a one-man storm who delivered a performance for the ages.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
