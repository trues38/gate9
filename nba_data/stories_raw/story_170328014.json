{"game_id": "170328014", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "MIAMI \u2013 On a night where offensive artistry was abandoned for a bare-knuckle brawl, the Miami Heat survived a historic, singular performance for the ages from Cleveland\u2019s Danny Ferry, escaping with an 83-79 victory.\n\nThe final score, a relic from a bygone era of basketball, belies the unbelievable narrative that unfolded. This was not a game won by a team, but one nearly stolen by one man. Danny Ferry, the Cavaliers' forward, detonated for a career-defining and utterly staggering 48 points, single-handedly keeping his team afloat in a sea of offensive ineptitude.\n\nWhile the Heat labored through a collective shooting nightmare, Ferry was a bastion of efficiency and fire. He was the Cleveland Cavaliers' offense, a one-man army waging war against the entire Miami defense. Every time the Heat threatened to pull away, Ferry answered with a clutch basket, his scoring total dwarfing the contributions of his teammates and challenging the entire Miami roster.\n\nMiami\u2019s victory was secured not by finesse, but by force and a balanced, if unspectacular, effort. Alonzo Mourning anchored the paint with 15 points and 13 rebounds, providing a crucial defensive presence, while Tim Hardaway facilitated with 10 points and 9 assists. P.J. Brown added a double-double of his own, a testament to the grinding, physical nature of the contest.\n\nBut this night will not be remembered for Miami\u2019s grit. It will be remembered for the night Danny Ferry ascended to a scoring plane few ever reach, putting the entire Heat franchise on notice and carrying his team on his back in a legendary, albeit losing, effort. The final horn signaled a Heat win, but the story was, and forever will be, the 48 points of Danny Ferry.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
