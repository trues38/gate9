{"game_id": "171122010", "title": "Synthetic Recap", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 In a defensive rock fight where points were a precious commodity, one man authored a masterpiece of historic proportions. Hakeem Olajuwon didn\u2019t just lead the Houston Rockets to a gritty 90-84 victory over the Golden State Warriors; he carried them, putting on a performance for the ages that defied the era\u2019s low-scoring realities.\n\nOn a night where both teams struggled to crack 90 points, Olajuwon was an unstoppable force of nature. The Dream poured in a colossal 42 points, a figure so immense it nearly accounted for half of his team\u2019s entire output. In a grinding, physical contest, his sublime footwork and soft touch around the rim were the only consistent offense on the floor. He was a one-man oasis in a desert of missed shots.\n\nThe Warriors, led by 20 points from Latrell Sprewell, had no answer. They clawed and scrapped, but Olajuwon\u2019s dominance in the paint was absolute. Every time Golden State threatened to close the gap, the Rockets went back to their well, and Olajuwon delivered. His final stat line\u201442 points and 13 rebounds\u2014was not just a box score filler; it was the entire story of the game.\n\nIn an age defined by its defensive brutality, Olajuwon\u2019s 42-point night stands as a monument to individual greatness. It was a reminder that even when the game is at its ugliest, true artistry can still prevail. The Rockets didn't just win a game; they were witnesses to a legend at the very peak of his powers.", "source": "AI_Reconstruction"}
