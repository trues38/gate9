J.R. Smith had 13 points for the Cavaliers, who shot 51 percent and were 14-of-34 from 3-point range.\nMarc Gasol led Memphis with 18 points, while Beno Udrih scored 15. Jeff Green had 11 points for Memphis, which had its three-game winning streak snapped.\nThe Grizzlies, who hold the second seed in the West, saw their advantage over third-place Houston shrink to 1 1/2 games after the Rockets defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 95-93 on Wednesday night.\nThe game was not in doubt after the big third quarter from the Cavaliers, who outscored Memphis 36-24 in the frame.\n\"It makes you have a sickness in your stomach because you know you're better than that,\" said Memphis forward Zach Randolph, who was limited to five points and three rebounds.\nCleveland controlled the boards with a 49-32 advantage. And while Memphis outscored Cleveland 50-38 in the paint, the Grizzlies converted only 25 of 49 shots in close.\n\"I thought we missed a lot of shots, and they were able to play free and loose, playing from the lead for most of the game,\" Memphis coach Dave Joerger said.\nThe game completely got away from Memphis in the third when Cleveland connected on 11 of its first 13 shots in the quarter, including three of four from 3-point range. The Cavaliers would convert 14 of 19 shots in the third, contributing to Cleveland extending its 13-point halftime lead to a 91-66 advantage entering the fourth -- a lead so substantial Joerger left his starters on the bench for the final period.\n\"Everyone really stepped up in the third quarter,\" Love said. \"So it was really, really good basketball.\"\nThe Cavaliers were able to convert because Memphis appeared to simply be going through the motions on both ends of the floor after halftime. The Grizzlies' defense, which is among the best in the league, was virtually nonexistent as Cleveland converted on dunks and jumpers.\n\"We obviously know how great they are defensively, especially in this building,\" James said. \"For us to move the ball and share the ball like we did in the facet that we did was very impressive.\"\nTIP-INS\nCavaliers: The game was Cleveland's last in the regular season against a Western Conference opponent. ...
