G Richard Hamilton missed his second straight game because of back spasms and Thibodeau did not expect him to travel to Indiana, where the Bulls play the Pacers on Sunday. ... This was the first in a stretch of 12 of 15 road games for the Nets, and Carlesimo wasn't thrilled about that. It culminates with eight straight on the road while the Barclay's Center hosts the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. \"I don't like it,\" Carlesimo said. \"I'd much rather the schedule was more balanced and we didn't have the circus in for whatever it's in for. A lot of teams go through this at different stages of the year. Some teams are fortunate they schedule away from the playoffs, and it really helps them. We're far from the lone rangers.
