Paul Millsap tied it for Atlanta before Durant knocked down the decisive 12-footer while being guarded by DeMarre Carroll.\n\"Coach just drew it out for me and I had to make a play,\" Durant said. \"It was an emotional game. It was up and down the whole game. My emotions were everywhere, so I just had to try to keep it together at the end of the game and make a play for my team.\"\nShelvin Mack tried to throw a pass to Millsap on the final play, but Thabo Sefolosha knocked it away. Millsap scored 23 points to lead the Hawks, who managed only one basket and two points in the final 3:50.\nOklahoma City is 6-0 at home this season when trailing going into the fourth quarter.\n\"I think that's a direct result from the competitive spirit we have,\" Thunder coach Scott Brooks said.\nDurant's 11-game streak of 30 or more points is the longest in the NBA since Tracy McGrady did it in 14 straight games in March and April 2003.\n\"He just hit some tough shots,\" Carroll said. \"The shots were contested and he hit them. I just think we really lost the game on our own. We missed two open threes. We got the shots that we wanted. We just missed them. We've got to learn from that but it was a hard-fought game.\""}
