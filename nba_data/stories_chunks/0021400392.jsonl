We have a team full of defenders, and everyone has to do their job.\"\nEspecially without Durant, who sat out after spraining his right ankle in the first half of the Thunder's loss at Golden State on Thursday night. Although Durant's X-rays were negative and the sprain was mild, Oklahoma City elected to be cautious with its superstar, who only made his season debut in early December after surgery on a broken right foot.\nAfter Westbrook put the Thunder up 104-101 in the final minute, Jeremy Lin hit a jumper with 32 seconds left. Westbrook missed a shot to set up the Lakers' final shot, but Bryant's jumper clanged off the rim.\nBryant said he got the shot he wanted but couldn't decide whether to try to draw contact.\n\"I didn't have my legs tonight,\" Bryant said. \"It was pretty frustrating. I've got to figure it out. It's kind of hit-and-miss. Some games it's there, and some games it's not. I've just got to keep trying different things to get the proper rest.\"\nBryant had nine points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Lakers, who had won three of four. He put the Lakers up 99-98 with 2:36 left on a gorgeous fall-away jumper, but it was his only basket of the fourth quarter, where he went 1-for-5."}
