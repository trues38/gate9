He knows how to get into the game with his mindset. He's just a total team guy. He's a guy that said to me 'anything you need from me. I will do. I just want to win. I'm for the team.' He's been completely a man of his word. A guy who shoots the ball the way he does, when he gets on roll like he did in the first half, it's a beautiful thing to watch.\""}
