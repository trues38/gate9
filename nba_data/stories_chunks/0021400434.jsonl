I don't know if I'll ever shoot that again but it was good to be able to say I did it.\"\nPaul Millsap led the Hawks with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Atlanta was coming off successive victories over Chicago, Cleveland, Houston, Dallas and the Los Angeles Clippers.\nThe teams meet again Saturday night in Milwaukee.\nAtlanta's 77 points were a season low, and the Hawks committed a season-high 23 turnovers that led to 30 Milwaukee points.\nThe Bucks led 58-42 at halftime, and the Hawks never came closer than 14 points in the second half. They trailed by as many as 32 in the fourth quarter.\n\"I think you've got to give Milwaukee a lot of credit tonight. They shot the ball really well, and did some different things,\" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said after the Hawks shot just 40.8 percent and allowed the Bucks to shoot 50.6.\nMilwaukee's bench continued its recent strong play in the second period, as Dudley, Jerryd Bayless, O.J. Mayo and John Henson outscored Atlanta's subs 32-7 in the first half.\nOther than Millsap, who made all eight of his shots in the first half to score 18, the rest of the Hawks shot 9-for-30 (30 percent).\nTIP-INS\nBucks: Milwaukee is 4-0 with Zaza Pachulia in the starting lineup.
