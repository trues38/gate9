Kyle Lowry's layup got the Raptors within 96-94, but Greivis Vasquez was called for a clear-path foul on Batum, who made one of a pair of free throws to keep Portland in front 97-94.\nLillard made a pair of free throws with 19.4 second left, and the Raptors couldn't catch up.\n\"We just had to stay the course, we knew they were one of the better teams in the league this season, top of the Eastern Conference and they've played well against Western Conference teams,\" Lillard said. \"We knew it was going to be a fight coming in.\"\nLowry finished with 25 points while James Johnson had 14 points and 11 rebounds for his first double-double of the season for Toronto.\nThe Raptors had won the first two games of their six-game road trip, including a 116-102 victory at Denver on Sunday.\nPortland was coming off a 101-79 rout of the New York Knicks on Sunday.\n\"They're one of the best teams in the NBA,\" Lowry said of the Blazers. \"They've got two All-Stars over there. They're a complete team.\"\nKnown for their 3-point shooting, the Blazers were uncharacteristically 2-for-17 from beyond the arc in the first half. Portland had 16 or more 3-pointers in each of the previous three games.\nAfter taking a 45-38 lead into the break, the Raptors extended their lead to 56-45 on James Johnson's tip shot in the third quarter.\nThe Blazers showed some spark at the end of the third quarter when Lillard nailed a 3-pointer to narrow Toronto's lead to 70-63.\nThe Blazers chipped away, and Lillard's layup narrowed it to 83-82 with 4:23 left. Aldridge tied it, making one of two free throws, but Terrence Ross answered with a reverse dunk for the Raptors.\nPortland took its first lead since the game's opening minutes on Aldridge's jumper with 1:36 to go.\nLowry missed an open jumper from the baseline, then his layup with 10 second left was blocked by Joel Freeland. But Amir Johnson's jumper with 4.7 seconds left tied it.\nLillard missed a layup as time ran out in regulation.\n\"I love the way we competed in a hostile environment,\" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. \"If you can compete in that environment, the way we did tonight, you can compete in a lot of places.\"\nTIP INS\nRaptors: Raptors' guard Terrence Ross went to Portland's Jefferson High School. ...... Landry Fields has missed four games because of a concussion.\nTrail Blazers: Before the game, the Blazers put center Meyers Leonard on the inactive list with a left shoulder strain. ... Portland had won the previous 10 of 11 against the Raptors.\nPUT A BOW ON 2014\nStotts is giving the Blazers the next two days off, including the New Year's Day.\n\"I'm pleased. I think anybody would have taken this record going into 2015,\" he said. \"The most important thing is that we've still got 49 games to go. We're not even halfway through. But it's good to be where we are.\"\nUP NEXT\nThe Raptors visit the Golden State Warriors on Friday.\nThe Trail Blazers host the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday."}
