# 🛠️ Technical Review: 4-Stage Data Pipeline (2025-12-02)

**Topic:** 'Can we automate Quality Control with n8n + LLM + Anti-Gravity?'

---

### 🎤 Round Table Transcript

**The Technocrat (Feasibility):**
- **Vote**: **DISAGREE**
- **Reason**: 95% noise filtering via n8n+LLM is overly optimistic. Complex market variables cannot be handled by simple automation rules alone.

**The Skeptic (Reliability):**
- **Vote**: **DISAGREE**
- **Reason**: "Top 10" lists create an **Echo Chamber**. We will miss hidden signals and outliers that are critical for a Hedge Fund.

**The Historian (Depth):**
- **Vote**: **DISAGREE**
- **Reason**: Shallow "Top 10" data lacks the historical depth required for PID analysis.

**Anti-Gravity (Validation):**
- **Vote**: **DISAGREE**
- **Reason**: Automated "Sanity Checks" cannot replace human intuition for complex context. Algorithms are limited by their programming and cannot detect "Unknown Unknowns" effectively without human oversight.

### 📝 Meta Reviewer Synthesis & Verdict

**1. Feasibility Assessment:**
- **Technically Possible?**: Yes, but effectiveness is doubted.
- **Consensus**: The team believes fully automated filtering is "Too Idealistic" and ignores the complexity of real-world data.

**2. Risk Assessment:**
- **Blind Spots**: "Top 10" bias (Echo Chamber). Missing non-mainstream signals.
- **False Security**: Over-reliance on "Automated Verification" could lead to catastrophic failure if the AI hallucinates or misses a subtle context.

**3. Final Verdict:** **REVISE**
*The proposal is rejected in its current form. The team demands Human-in-the-Loop or a more robust, multi-source strategy that goes beyond "Top 10".*
